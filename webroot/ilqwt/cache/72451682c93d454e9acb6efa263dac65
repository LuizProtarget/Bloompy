Itâs October, which only means one thing: pink ribbons, yogurt labels, football jerseys and buckets of fried chicken will be popping up everywhere. Breast Cancer Awareness Month is upon us, and itâs with that news that I warn: itâs all a scam. What’s clear is that women of all ethnicities and races need to be aware of the signs of the disease, and marketing of services and information could make an impact. Participants honor cancer survivors and loved ones at hundreds of walking and running events across the country, raising millions of dollars for research. The charity claimed that a total of 29 million people were reached across various social platforms, contributing to a 27,984% uplift of traffic to their website. Every ribbon makes a difference. It’s also a fantastic opportunity to engage the local community through educational events and fundraising challenges.  For treatment with a prize — a paid day off, 50/50 raffle,!
