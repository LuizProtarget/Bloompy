Although there are several other types of milling machines, shown is the vertical milling machine. c. Both a and b. d. None of the above. b. Vertical milling machine. Milling machine is used for machining flat surfaces, contoured surfaces, surfaces of revolution, external and internal threads, and helical surfaces of various cross-sections. They can also be used to drill, bore, cut gears, and produce slots. Milling Spur Gear on Milling Machine The gear blank is mounted on a mandrel which is supported between the center of the dividing head and one more center at the other end, as shown in fig.

Starting with a 127 tooth gear, I will be making up a few differant tooth counts. I already had a 1/8 “ carbide slot mill but I needed to buy a 5/64” end mill, so I bought a set from Amazon. The Z datum however was set accurately using a piece of paper between the end mill and the top of the blank stock. . I needed the 2mm which is very close in diameter to 5/64”. This was held down with a couple of clamps positioned near the edges of the stock so as not to interfere with the cutting process. When machining gears, cutting is done ____ (toward/away from) the dividing head. 12. c. Both a and b. d. None of the above. The question I get asked most is ( How do you make the gears),or more often, where did you purchase them? To cut gears with different number of teeth a different cutter is required for each gear. The micrometer dial of vertical feed screw is set to zero in this position. Found inside – Page 168Milling cutters are also available for cutting surfaces of revolution, cutting off metals, machining threads, and cutting gears as shown in Figures 6.6–6.8. The center hole and the slots were milled first, then the center of the gear needed to be clamped down. 					 I sat the part on a small piece of wood so I didn’t cut into the table when I cut through the stock. see &quot;dividing head - dividing the circle&quot; For a truly comprehensive explanation of gears the reader is referred to &quot;Gears and Gear Cutting&quot; by Ivan Law.
