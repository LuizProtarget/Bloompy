Sleepwalking, or somnambulism, occurs when sleeping and waking are combined and the individual wanders around in a dazed and uncoordinated state (Kales et al., 1980).

Dreaming occurs, high brain activity, physical appearance of deep sleep. On campus, Charlotte works at an implicit social cognition research lab, is an editor for the undergraduate law review, and plays softball.

Term. Stage 1,2,3, and 4, are categorized as &#x27;non-REM sleep&#x27;, and the fifth stage, is REM sleep. It is called slow wave sleep because the brain waves slow to what are known as delta waves with the occasional faster wave. Another NREM disorder is sleepwalking, which can occur together with sleep terrors. During N3, your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels, and your muscles are so relaxed that it may be hard to awaken you (Lockett, 2020). During the transition into Stage 1 sleep, it is common to experience hypnic jerks.

REM sleep is defined by rapid eye movements and an almost complete paralysis of the body, and a tendency to dream. This stage is heavily regulated by the brainstem (McCarley et al., 1995), which is the region of the brain that connects the cerebrum with the spinal cord. Additionally, it is in this stage that human growth hormone (HGH) is released. Non-rapid eye movement sleep is known for its beneficial effect on memory consolidation, especially for declarative memory (while procedural memory improvement is more associated with REM-sleep), even if it is important to note that a clear-cut distinction between stages&#x27; influence on type of learning doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible. There are two main categories of sleep, Non-Rapid Eye Movement or Non-REM (NREM) and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). Non-REM sleep contains light stages of sleep (stage 1), to full sleep (Stage 2), and deep or slow wave sleep (stages 3 and 4). Overall, your body spends more time in NREM phases of sleep. Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Arousal Disorders; Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders involve episodes of incomplete awakening from sleep, usually occurring during the first third of a major sleep episode, and are accompanied by either sleepwalking or sleep terrors.
