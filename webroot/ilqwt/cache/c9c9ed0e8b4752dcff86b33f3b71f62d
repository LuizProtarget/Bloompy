I want to access 'context' for the sake of authentication in my DataLoader. You can read more about resolver in Apollo Server documentation.. Run your queries on the server before rendering the page HTML. For example, a model file for User would include all the logic for operating on users, and might look something like this: In the following example, our schema has multiple ways to request a single user: Rather than having the same fetching logic for a single user in two separate places, it usually makes sense to move that logic to the model file. It&#x27;s the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source. If there&#x27;s anything that the resolver needs to execute appropriately (database details, authentication information, etc. React, an intuitive web frontend framework, extends its capabilities in building apps for mobile and VR. This book aims to help you in building React applications through a series of real-world projects increasing in complexity as you ... GraphQL context is crucial in a GraphQL architecture to bring external information in the graph for wise data resolving. Instructs Apollo Server to begin listening for incoming requests: Takes an options object as a parameter, which is passed to the listen method of http.Server. If you pass Infinity, Apollo Server waits indefinitely for all active connections to go idle. An object (or a function that creates an object) that's passed to every resolver that executes for a particular operation. Here is a quick guide to quickly get you started Intro to GraphQL with Prisma. Add Members. For more information on middleware in general, see the integrations page. Project setup Init project mkdir node-graphql-api cd node-graphql-api npm init --yes npm install mongoose npm install apollo-server graphql npm install nodemon dotenv @babel/core @babel/node @babel/plugin-transform-async-to-generator @babel/plugin-transform-runtime @babel/preset-env --save-dev package.json . You may have noticed that our models also exist on the context, alongside the user object we added earlier. Found inside – Page 491Apollo Server provides a mechanism by which a context can be passed through to all resolvers. Until now, we only used the first two arguments in any ... It then fetches the corresponding user object for that token and adds that object to the context object that's passed to every executed resolver. Also as shown, the function should create a new instance of each data source for each operation. Rather than doing any authentication or authorization work in the GraphQL layer (in resolvers/models), it's possible to simply pass through the headers or cookies to your REST endpoint and let it do the work. // Note: This example uses the `req` argument to access headers. How to pass it from the server to the resolvers? Connect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search. apollo-client: a fully-featured, production-ready caching GraphQL client for every server or UI framework. To perform this kind of authorization, we can modify the context function: The only difference from the basic context function is the check for the user. Sets the approximate size (in MiB) of the server's DocumentNode cache. It is the key to handling authorization in our Apollo server. Awesome.
