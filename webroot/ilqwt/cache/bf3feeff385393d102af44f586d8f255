HITRUST divides risk into three categories: organizational, system, or regulatory risks. and implementation of a PLC-based water level control system. Evaluation is a process that critically examines a program. Implementation levels are assigned to each of the 135 controls listed in the CSF. Finally, at the Control condition school (School 4) the program was not delivered.

Program theory, summative model, and interpersonal theory b. HITRUST helps reassure consumers, investors, and business partners that your company cares about its responsibility to protect PHI. Phase Three focuses on operations, monitoring and evaluation activities. Regardless of different clientele, hospitals, health insurers, biotech companies, and pharmaceutical companies all have one thing in common — they have personal health information that hackers want. During the assessment, companies undergo onsite interviews, documentation reviews, and system testing. Personal information like healthcare information is particularly valuable on the black market thus making any entity with that information a prime target. They partner with program developers, external consultants, and intermediary organizations to ensure they have the competencies needed to support and sustain implementation at the staff level as well as at the organization level. It determines a company’s scope, helps document tests, and assists in monitoring remediation.

In pursuit of this goal, the Alliance developed a security evaluation process that, once completed, gives healthcare providers a certification. When all three types of risks are considered, they determine which implementation level is appropriate for a certain control. Whatever sector of the health industry, volume refers to the extent of operations both on the business and consumer side. Once a list of controls is provided, conduct a self-audit using the HITRUST self-assessment tool to determine where there are gaps or if controls are missing entirely. What if these devices are compromised? He states that these phases come in a sequential order, but they often overlap one another. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module. Leading services researchers have noted the need for models, like that provided in Figure 1 , to link key implementation stages and outcomes to service and patient outcomes [ 13 , 14 ]. Since HITRUST is an amalgamation of regulations, it approaches penalties differently than typical government regulations. The young and the old alike rely on doctors to keep them healthy and usually, in that pursuit, reveal personal details to their health practitioners.
