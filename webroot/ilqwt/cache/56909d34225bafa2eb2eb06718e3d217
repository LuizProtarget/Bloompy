In the case of personal computers, some of the input, output, and storage devices are built into the same physical unit. An input device is any hardware device that sends data to a computer, allowing you to interact with and control it. Input device is used for providing data and instructions to the computer. We know that generally the transistor has three terminals – emitter (E), base (B) and collector. After processing the input data, computer provides output to the user via the output device.
