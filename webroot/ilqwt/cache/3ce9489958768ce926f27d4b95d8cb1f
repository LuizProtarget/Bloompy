But he was assassinated in June 1800 by a Syrian student, and command of the French army went to general Menou. [3]. However, with Austria and Russia preparing an invasion of France and its allies, he had to change his plans and turn his attention to the continent. Off the port of Rochefort, after unsuccessfully attempting to escape to the United States, Napol�on made his formal surrender while on board HMS Bellerophon on 15 July 1815. His father, Carlo Buonaparte, an attorney, was named Corsica's representative to the court of Louis XVI in 1778, where he remained for a number of years.

He later boasted that he had cleared the streets with a "whiff of grapeshot" (musket balls fired in cloth bags from the cannon, a devastating anti-personnel munition), although the fighting had been vicious throughout Paris.
