PAN may develop in a subacute fashion, over several weeks or months. It can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs. Definition of Autoimmune Disease. It highlighted the importance of someone caring about whether the drug treatment had worked by providing follow up after initial information and treatment had taken place [26]. Patients may have nonspecific complaints such as fever, malaise, weight loss, anorexia, and abdominal pain. Finally, an inherent limitation of thematic syntheses is that the line-by-line coding, identification of descriptive themes, and generation of analytical themes is a subjective process. Raynaud syndrome, joint pains, various skin abnormalities, muscle weakness, and problems with internal organs can develop. Mendelson C. Gentle hugs: women living with lupus...proceedings of the communicating nursing research conference and WIN assembly, ‘Responding to societal imperatives through discovery and innovation’, held April 10-12, 2003, Scottsdale, Arizona. 2012;71(11):1771–82. Systemic vasculitis may be directly related to infections, including bacterial, viral, or parasitic. Clin Exp Rheumatol. Qual Health Res. In a study of SLE patients, one patient states how they were adherent to not be selfish after all the time and effort their friends, family and care workers invested in helping them manage their condition: “people around me, like my mum will take off so much time from work and she will give so much of herself and my dad and just, even like my family friends who I had never met before would give so much of themselves, so I just thought ‘you are being selfish’ (by not taking the tablets), so it kind of clicked, so I just take the drugs.” [40].

[11], In aplastic anemia the body fails to produce blood cells in sufficient numbers. In terms of what motivates SARD patients to take their medications as prescribed, we found that using medication to prolong their life and to have their condition improve, particularly out of concern for their families, were important as described in 13 studies [19, 32,33,34, 37, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 51, 54, 55]. 2010;8(1):36. 2006;16(7):982–97. 1 identified 7392 articles after the removal of duplicates, with 197 forwarded for full-text review.                 statement and Side effects of medications also contributed to some of these negative impacts on the emotional and social well-being of SARD patients – for example, being bullied at school [34] or not wanting to socialize and withdrawing from activities because of weight gain [20]. In a study of adolescents with SLE, authors found forgetting to take medications occurred in many patients “many teens reported episodes where they had forgotten” [19]. Autoimmune diseases may be systemic and affect many parts of the body, or they may affect only specific organs or regions. Musculoskelet.

A major understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases has been the application of genome-wide association scans that have identified a degree of genetic sharing among the autoimmune diseases. 2016;25(9):1028–39.

Given the paucity of existing adherence interventions targeting this patient population, our review has certain practical implications for care, namely the need to address emotional and social impacts of medication use and the necessity of establishing a meaningful and trusting professional relationship with patients. Antibodies to double-stranded DNA is the hallmark of SLE. However, patients also had negative experiences with their healthcare providers, including feeling like they were treated as a “guinea pig” for research or that their provider did not truly listen to their concerns about their treatment [34]. Correspondence to [1] Intravenous immunoglobulin may also occasionally be used. For thematic synthesis, we included studies identified in our systematic review as well as studies from the aforementioned prior systematic review of patient experiences with SLE [14] that met our inclusion criteria. In autoimmune diseases, the body attacks normal, healthy tissues. This includes the beliefs that their conditions are not severe enough to warrant medication or a lack understanding about their treatments. It is probably a combination of a person’s genes and something in the environment that triggers those genes. Dermatomyositis is a rare autoimmune disease.

Although the definition of SIRS refers to it as an "inflammatory" response, it actually has pro- and anti-inflammatory components. [5], Autoimmune diseases present similar symptoms across the more than eighty different types. As one of our objective was to update the prior systematic review of patient experiences with SLE [14] but with a focus on medication taking, we considered studies in SLE published 2013 and onwards, as identified in our search strategy, for the systematic review. Our findings also suggest that SARDs patients valued having someone follow them up to see whether their treatment was working as intended [26]. The man-in-the-moon face: a qualitative study of body image, self-image and medication use in systemic lupus erythematosus.

Arthritis Care Res. Signs and symptoms presented, and the disease itself, can be influenced by various other factors such as age, hormones, and environmental factors.

A systemic autoimmune disease characterized by variable involvement of the skin, muscles, joints, heart, liver, kidney, lungs, and central nervous system and the presence of certain antibodies against self antigens, including anti-DNA antibodies. This is contrast with theme 2, which touched on the desire to have control over their treatment and associated side effects. Systemic inflammatory diseases compose a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an excessive immune response against several self-antigens, due to the interaction between genetic predisposing factors, dysregulation of the immune system, and environmental factors. In many systemic inflammatory diseases,... 2013;28(2):171–88. Interviews with SLE patients revealed the importance of knowing that their rheumatologist cares and taking the time to explain patients’ conditions and treatments: “He is trying very hard to help me at least get close to my normal life. I wish more doctors could see things that way” [50]. [citation needed], Some infections, such as Campylobacter jejuni, have antigens that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. How to use systemic in a sentence. Finally, three studies included patients as well as healthcare providers and caregivers [21, 24, 31].

Altogether thematic synthesis of these 40 studies involved 1522 SARD patients and identified seven predominant, overlapping, and interlocking analytical themes that touch on the perspectives of SARD patients on medication taking: 1) effects of medication on emotional and social well-being, 2) impacts of healthcare provider relationships on treatment, 3) gaining control over treatment, 4) fear and concern with side effects of treatment, 5) understanding the importance of treatment, 6) practical barriers to taking medication, and 7) motivation towards adherence to treatment. Synthesis of primary research studies addresses inherent limitations including small sample sizes and issues with generalizability [13]. An abnormal condition of a part, organ, or system of an organism resulting from various causes, such as infection, inflammation, environmental factors, or genetic defect, and characterized by an identifiable group of signs, symptoms, or both.
