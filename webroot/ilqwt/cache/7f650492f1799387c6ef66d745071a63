The opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 had great significance in Australian society. The bridge, an architectural marvel, cemented Australiaâs status as a rising nation, joined Sydneyâs two shores, alleviated the effects of the great depression and the opening provided a stage for the theatrics of the semi-fascist New Guard. The northern end of the bridge starts from Misons Point and the southern (central business district) end of the bridge starts at Dawes Point in The Rocks area.
