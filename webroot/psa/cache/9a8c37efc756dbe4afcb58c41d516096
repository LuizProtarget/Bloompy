A straight bevel gearbox with straight cut teeth are utilized in slow speed applications, whereas spiral bevel gearboxes with curved teeth are utilized in high performance, high speed applications. Gear Train – two or more gears meshed by their teeth. B. • Medical – In the medical industry, gearboxes are used in surgical tables, patient beds, medical diagnostic machines, dental equipment and MRI and CAT scan machines. 4. The unique combination of both power transmission efficiency and compact size allows for a lower loss in efficiency. Product Name. As a result, when the driver is powered, the motor shaft rotates inside the gearbox causing the output shaft of the gearbox to rotate. In this configuration, the input shaft rotates the sun gear, the planet gears rotate on their own axes, simultaneously applying a torque to the rotating planet carrier that in turn applies torque to the output shaft (which in this case is the annulus). Note: Gears made from steel materials can be noisy when coming into contact with other gears and also make them prone to wear. All gearboxes work in a similar fashion. Straight gear teeth gearboxes are typically used in low-speed applications. There are two types of bevel gears which are straight and spiral. Gearmotors Motor Type.
