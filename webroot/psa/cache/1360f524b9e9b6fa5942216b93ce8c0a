They are soon joined by Richard I. Scylla and Charybdis. In this general context of guilt, Stephen is also reminded of his mother’s death, and we learn that despite his somewhat priggish refusal to pray at her bedside, he did indeed weep for her: “I wept alone.” As Stephen speaks of Anne Hathaway’s seduction of young William Shakespeare, a woman several years Shakespeare’s senior, Stephen cannot help but muse about his own future and wonder when some buxom wench, some “greyeyed goddess,” will “overtip” him in a cornfield: “And my turn?
