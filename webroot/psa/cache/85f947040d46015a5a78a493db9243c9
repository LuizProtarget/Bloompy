Whedon’s right to imply that his small-screen resurrection cheapened the character somewhat, but it helps if you don’t watch “Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D” anyway. An excitable, confused, wisecracking, impulsive, naive kid. Marvel’s most important character is not Iron Man, in case that needs clarifying. If I had a fight with my girlfriend I’d read Peter and MJ and know what to do, if I had a problem with a friend or a classmate I’d read ‘Best of Enemies’ and know that friendship could survive minor problems like those.” — TomLudo00, Marvel community. Not quite a supervillain, Sam Rockwell proved one of the few real highlights of “Iron Man 2.” Rockwell had been on the shortlist to play Tony Stark before Downey Jr. bagged the gig, and plays corporate scumbag Hammer like an evil twin of the hero, with the cocky asshole dial pushed all the way up. In some ways, by shifting into actual an actual television/streaming format for WandaVision, fans get that sort of payoff and excitement (sometimes in a massive way) at the end of every episode. More Agatha, please. Between all the pop-up surprise appearances that heâs made over... 2. ).To put that into context, it’s more than the next three top-sellers, the Avengers ($325 million) and D.C.’s Batman ($494 million) and Superman ($277 million) combined. I do think she is amazing in hand-to-hand combat, but sheâs ultimately just a human. So far, so Peter Parker. The Hulk is one of the most well-known Marvel characters and is constantly mentioned as being one of the most powerful beings in the universe. In addition to doing good things for Hawkeye and Black Widow, ‘Age of Ultron’ spreads the love to include B-list superheroes, and no one benefits more than War Machine. Emil Blonsky/The Abomination Those who only knew actor Sebastian Stan by reputation from “Gossip Girl” were duly impressed when he turned up as Cap’s best bud Bucky in “Captain America” —it was a nice little performance that suggested talent beyond teen drama. When there are literal gods bouncing around in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, of course they're going to wind up on a list of the most powerful characters. Despite all of the damage that the Winter Soldier has caused, fans still love him and his story. Hopefully Phase Three and his big appearance in “Infinity Wars” will be more impressive, and Josh Brolin will have time to ease into a character who right now is underwhelming. Now there were Spider-men. He's shown up not once, not twice, but 10 times throughout the course of the 23 films, and somehow that doesn't feel like enough. “Peter isn’t simply a character, he’s a life companion, a friend, he’s one of the very few characters in comics who did grow, and readers grew with him… Reading Amazing Spider-Man was like talking with a friend about anything. William Hurt did a solid job, bringing nuance and control to a character who could have just been a caricature (and kind of was, as played by Sam Elliott in Ang Lee’s 2003 entry) but not enough to render him truly memorable. When Bruce Banner gets angry, things get smashed. The Hulk is one of the most well-known Marvel characters and is constantly mentioned as being one of the most powerful beings in the universe. In the MCU, the Hulk maintains that record. And while credit is absolutely due to Lord, Miller and Spider-Verse directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman, it’s also testament to Spider-Man’s innate multi-faceted, multiverse appeal. And even during the Hulk’s rampages, Banner’s empathy, torture and confusion bleed through. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has not always been kind to women. Casting Ben Kingsley as Iron Man’s best-known villain, the fearsome But let’s start with Marvel’s origins. Cooper’s accent is a little wavy, but it’s a fun foreshadowing of the friendly/tense dynamic between Cap and Tony Stark that’s proving increasingly central to the mega-franchise. Killmonger even though is the villain but got many loves from MCU fans. Indelibly associated with Robert Downey Jr., it’s hard to tell if Marvel owes him more or less than he owes Marvel in terms of it establishing him as one of the biggest stars in the world after a long period on the rehab/bender/uninsurable roundabout. In fact, theyâve come close a few times and there is one indisputable great Marvel movie villain.

Scarlet Witch & Vision have a tragic time. It’s no coincidence that pre-MCU Marvel hero movies featured the heavy hitters Marvel had touted around to other film studios before it had its own outlet: Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men and Fantastic Four. And now with the aforementioned WandaVision—the first MCU series to land on Disney+ and feel like its seriously tying in with the expansive running storyline—the footprint continues to expand and push the story forward. Her character history is beyond rich, from being trained by the Winter Soldier in â¦ Earning consideration for this list almost solely because he was the first Marvel Cinematic Universe villain, it’s not that Jeff Bridges‘ Stane, the double-crossing ex-business-partner of Tony’s Dad Howard, was necessarily a terrible character, although it’s a trope that anyone who’d ever watched a film before could see coming a mile away. The problem with the Vision is he is superhuman, as strong as Thor. A character so popular she got her own (decent) spin-off TV show, Hayley Atwell’s Peggy Carter was Captain America’s great wartime love. 36. Mackie first cropped up in “The Winter Soldier” as Captain America’s new BFF, a soldier with a jet-powered backpack, and he lent the film some graceful comic notes while also suggesting both PTSD and an adrenaline junkie’s hunger for a return to action, which added some humanity to the film. Hot-headed, impatient and super fast, the ‘Ultron’ version of Quicksilver, aka Pietro Maximoff, is very different from the insouciant and flippant teenager version seen in “X-Men: Days Of Future Past.” And that’s because aside from their powers, they’re basically two different characters. Indeed, Marvelâs history is long, deep and complex, making the whole notion of a most important character rather a tangled web â but one weâre determined to unweave. Tony Stark discovers that he’s actually a Itâs simply actors fulfilling the same roles, but within a different universe. "Shang-Chi" is one of the boldest and definitely the most poetic MCU film to date.

Luckily the complex antagonists, protagonists, and story-lines of the Marvel Cinematic Universe provides us with plenty of â¦ Thor: Ragnarok is a hilarious, exciting, and unexpected Marvel movie that stands out from every other film in the MCU, while proving to be one of the best big-budget blockbusters of 2017. Nearly all the Avengers share loyalty traits and have more complex characteristics than bravery and smartness. Joss Whedon‘s follow up to his own “The Avengers,” famously the third most financially successful film of all time, is undoubtedly going to make a little more than chump change at the box office, having already earned $201 million from the 44 territories worldwide in which it opened last week, which places it above the opening weekend figures for “Iron Man 3” and “The Avengers” in most countries. #SpiderVerse, Its another reason I treasure Spider-verse apart from being a great movie in its own right we rarely get to see black kids in this sort of stories where they get to just have fun,discover themselves and leap off buildings. MalekithSure, some of his material was cut out of “Thor: The Dark World,” and the character had the natural disadvantage of being a less-than-fearsome-sounding Dark Elf, but Malekith remains the crappiest villain in a series of movies that have generally had some pretty rubbish villains. The comeback of Mickey Rourke seemed complete when after the success of “The Wrestler,” he was picked to play the villainous Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash, in “Iron Man 2.” Covered in “Eastern Promises”-style tattoos, straggly hair and brandishing massive electro-whips, he made for a striking figure, but aside from a gloriously random parrakeet, the actor’s eccentricities weren’t really let out to play, and the villain ultimately proved to be a negligible threat, dying swiftly in Marvel’s most underwhelming conclusion so far. 27.

But by hook or by crook, Marvel does a really excellent job at intertwining the characters in it's universe to make it feel like just that—a live action,  interconnected, comic book universe. But Downey Jr.’s nine screen appearances as Tony Stark (not including his cameo at the end of The Incredible Hulk) is equalled by Spider-Man, including the upcoming Spider-Man: Far From Home, across all his movie outings – and that’s before we know if he will re-materialize in Avengers: Endgame. For the time being, at least. A small dent in his reputation. But beyond its unusual theme, WandaVision is also hugely relevant in the MCU, since it depicts the official appearance of the Scarlet Witch, as the powerhouse she was in the comics. And hey, she gets to go to the “Age Of Ultron” party! 22. In the MCU, the Hulk maintains that record. But while the most recent iteration may not have a film all to himself, the character is still the most interesting onscreen version we’ve seen to date and singlehandedly makes The Hulk one of the best characters in the MCU. That said, it was still fun to see Del Toro fly his freak flag as a sort of space Liberace-with-Jarmusch-hair. If Hercules is added to the franchise, it only makes sense to bring Ares along as well. But Bautista finds moments of humor in his character’s otherwise smashy-smashy-VENGEANCE persona (all the funnier because they’re played as though he’s unaware he’s being funny) and the relationship between him and Groot is a bromance (tree-mance) for the ages. However, sorting the Marvel heroes and villains is different from sorting Harry Potter characters. Marvel Cinematic Universe..Two years ago, she was engaged by Marvel Studios to join Scarlett Johansson as an additional version of Black Widow. The trailers intentionally tell a very specific story about Wenwu, that story is a lie. Tell us your thoughts in the comments, and if we haven’t provided you with enough fodder to get really, really mad with us above, remember we also Ranked Every Marvel Film Ever…, –Oli Lyttelton, Jessica Kiang, Rodrigo Perez. One of the original six Avengers, Jeremy Renner has the interesting distinction of being introduced with a fairly small cameo in the original Thor. Vision isn't that powerful, he just can control matter and life Mjolnir. Ruffalo’s interpretation says so much with so little, and if Banner is even more angsty in ‘Ultron,’ it reveals a complicated individual too worried about his inner anger to let impending happiness and even burgeoning romance in. He played key roles in all three Captain America movies, while also popping in for both Infinity War and Endgame. With any luck, he could continue appearing for years to come. Erik SelvigStellan Skarsgard is always worth the price of admission, and the “Thor” movies allowed him to play a neat twist on the scientist/mentor type: bonding with the title character through boozing in the first film and being all naked and crazy in “The Dark World.” He’s not fared as well outside those two films unfortunately, being reduced to an exposition delivery device in the “Avengers” films, when he’s not a blank-eyed zombie under mind control. 3. Zoe Saldana‘s lithe green-skinned Gamora on the one hand kicks some serious ass and has a kind of interestingly conflicted backstory (the trained assassin/adoptive daughter of Thanos, who has betrayed and rebelled against him) that’s usually reserved for the male antihero. ... One struggles to find a comparable one-off villain â¦ 3: Natasha Romanoff, one of the most complex characters in the MCU, the Russos did an exceptional job with her, and I adore her fight sequences. We touched on ‘The Night Gwen Stacy Died’, but there are other examples. Yet, what seals Spider-Man’s place at the pinnacle of the superhero pantheon, is his versatility. Some are less so. But hey, enough of my yakkin'; whaddaya say? Financially, it was a no-brainer. To date, there have been 12 separate Spider-Man TV series, mostly animated (including a 1967 initiator whose catchy theme tune — and its lyrics — is rivalled only by the 1960s’ Batman show’s “na-na-na-na” theme). This is a complex and compelling dynamic, and itâs arguable that Loki has the most complex and multifaceted relationship with a parental figure within the MCU. In fact, he’s most comfortable as a soldier, a leader and a big part of the heroism examination of ‘Ultron’ is thanks to Captain America’s drive to push past beyond the team’s nightmares and face their fear head on. Though only just. 3. The debut Marvel print appearance dates back to 1939’s Timely Publications, the same year that World War II began. Darcy Lewis Zemo in particular is far more interesting in the comics than in the MCU in my opinion(in fact, I consider the MCU version of him to be a really simple and one-note character). … seemingly out of nowhere, came a surprise. Such popularity inevitably swung Spidey from the comic-book page and onto the screen. Search the world's largest fan wiki platform. Since its release in September 2018, Insomniac Games’ Marvel’s Spider-Man has become the fastest, and best-selling superhero game ever, surpassing Batman: Arkham Knight which held the top spot since 2015. “He has a Spider-verse, a theme song and an excellent rogues’ gallery… Spider-Man is someone who doesn’t often deal with cosmic entities or universal threats (unless it’s Thanos with the Avengers). Ranked: All The Characters Of The Marvel Cinematic Universe. VR avatar probably a combination of Roger Rabbit and Llewyn Davis. Loki â Tom Hiddleston âs portrayal of the Asgardian God of Mischief (official title, I believe) is spot on. A longtime adversary for the Hulk in the comics (and, not coincidentally the father of Betty), General Ross hasn’t yet ventured into the wider Marvel universe outside of his mostly antagonistic appearance in “The Incredible Hulk,” the black sheep of the Marvel movies. Up next? Wanda's role has been steadily increasing within the MCU ever since her first appearance in the post-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Vin Dieselâs turn as Groot is likely the most fan-pleasing character in the MCU, and a license to print money for Marvel. After the kid was killed in the robbers’ revenge, he brought them to the police, and cried over the loss. Betty Ross would be the most obvious exception to that rule. He lived to fight another day, albeit horribly burned (the character becomes the masked villain Crossbones in the comics, and he’s said to play a major part in next year’s “Civil War”), so fingers crossed there’ll be more to come. Interviews with leading film and TV creators about their process and craft. Spider-Man is the heart of Marvel’s line-up. So taking only those films that count toward this Cinematic Universe ( from “Iron Man” in May 2008 up to and including ‘Ultron’ this week), we’ve selected and ranked (worst to best) the 50 characters that made some sort of an impression on us.There are many smaller characters we simply left off for reasons of space and our sanity, some of whom we’ll round up at the end, but any of whom you are welcome to make a case for in the comments. First off, they are an integral part of the world building: what always made Marvel Comics feel real was a lived-in universe filled with a diverse supporting cast, and characters like the elder Ant-Man and Howard Stark remind us how everything is connected in the MCU. Before entering the MCU, Spider-Man underwent a Sony reboot. I would just like to point out that Loki and Baron Zemo are incredibly deep, complex, and most notably progressive characters in the comics. She sadly doesn’t get that much screen time nor that much dialogue, but she looks fucking cool, is a deeply sadististic character and is the perfect sparring partner for Gamora, so we look forward to seeing her in the sequel. Tim Roth was atypical casting and brings a certain low-key energy to a military man that makes him more interesting than he could have been, but the more villainous he becomes, the more you lose interest, and by the end he might as well have just been called Evil Hulk. Nick Fury: 10 appearances. As the CEO of Stark Industries and Tony Stark's romantic interest, Gwyneth Paltrow has been a part of the MCU for as long as she's been the founder of Goop (Seriously! Of course, Marvel, and even films starring the comic book â¦ Even Kingpin, latterly associated much more with Daredevil, started out fighting the web-slinger (in Amazing Spider-Man #50, July 1967), a point recognised in the recent Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse which pitted the rotund criminal mastermind against Spidey. Spider-Man 3 features the most popular Marvel superhero and might bring a significant storyline development to the MCU. I made it through Black Panther without my eyes watering. Sometimes people don't take superhero movies super seriously, but seeing the way this character grows through the movies is really impressive work by both Downey and the people writing the character as well. One of the de facto leaders of the bunch, you could argue that no one's made more of an impression through the years than Chris Evans as this super-soldier who bleeds positivity.
