As of Thursday, the United States had recorded over 23 million COVID cases and 385,178 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University. A total of 15,928 patients had at least 1 CRP-PCR test. Cumulatively, these observations suggest that recent documented eCoV infection is associated with less-severe COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 infection were included. 2021 Jul;54(4):238-244. doi: 10.3961/jpmph.21.071. Bendavid E, Oh C, Bhattacharya J, Ioannidis JPA.

Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial. Outcomes of interest were proportion SARS-CoV-2 tested, SARS-CoV-2 positivity, hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. At the other extreme, cardiac inflammation may stimulate myocardial infarction . Larger studies and causal investigations are needed to identify the mechanisms and persistence of this inferred heterotypic immune protection. The greater likelihood of illness prompting CRP-PCR evaluation may also account for the higher level of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing among the eCoV+ as compared with the eCoV– group.        Older age and presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk for hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. The last documented CRP-PCR result prior to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test occurred significantly more recently in the eCoV+ (median 121 days, IQR 69–440 days) as compared with the eCoV– patients (median 359 days, IQR 117–799 days; P < 0.0001) (Figure 1A).

Bhattacharya was also among a group of scientists who wrote The Great Barrington Declaration, a controversial statement that encouraged governments to lift lockdown restrictions to achieve herd immunity among young and healthy people, while focusing protections on the elderly. 				in: Both a commercial Abbott assay and an in-house assay (12) were used to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital during this study period due to testing and material limitations.

After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and DM, the HR remained 0.3, although the CI became much wider and encompassed unity (0.0 to 2.0). Cumulatively, these observations suggest that recent documented eCoV infection is associated with less-severe COVID-19. The EMR provides scant information from which a patient’s burden of infection may be inferred, but Ct values from SARS-CoV-2 tests may be used for extrapolation. All metrics &gt;&gt;.

Higher levels of plasma inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), correlate with more severe disease (13), supporting the concept that inflammatory responses contribute to pathophysiology. However, the researchers also acknowledged that the study had limitations, and noted that "cross-country comparisons are difficult," since nations may have different rules, cultures, and relationships between their government and citizenry. 2021 Jul 5;10(7):623. doi: 10.3390/biology10070623. doi: 10.1111/eci.13599. Since SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause for COVID-19, some have questioned whether exposure to seasonal common cold coronaviruses (CCCs) could provide tangible protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or disease.

PubMed RT-PCR Ct values were obtained from a commercial Abbott assay (Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 for m2000 RT-PCR) and an in-house assay (12). The number of patients at risk at different time points is shown. Four different human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E) are among the most common etiologic agents for the seasonal common cold and also cause pneumonia (1, 2). 1, 2 The clinical presentation of these two conditions is highly variable and may be proceeded by coryzal symptoms or non-specific features of general malaise, fatigue or diarrhoea. Importantly, we observed that the eCoV+ as compared with the eCoV– group had lower rates of ICU admission and death after COVID-19 diagnosis.
