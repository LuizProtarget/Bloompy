If he can follow in Patrick Mahomes' footsteps and win a Super Bowl this year, Jackson will have an impeccable résumé to start his career. This fascinating collection compiles funny stories and a trunkful of trivia: What was the first car to break the sound barrier? Who won the first Indy 500? What kind of car was dancer Isadora Duncan in when she was killed? Some of the story themes include key player profiles and memorable moments; curses, folklore, and superstitions; stadiums, scandals, and politics; fan stories; oddities; play-off and World Series appearances; major trades; influential draft ... Jordan's ascension from very good player to one of the best defensive ends in football over the past three years has helped drive his candidacy. Nelson doesn't play a high-profile position, but he's off to a great start. Of the 16 Hall-eligible first-rounders who were first-team All-Pros as rookies, nine are enshrined. The blue-hued morning mist hugs the Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains. Work to do (10% to 39%): QB Matthew Stafford, CB Jeff Okudah. We're in a pass-happy era, but Thomas has more receptions (470) and receiving yards (5,512) than any other players in league history through their first four seasons. Eleven ales, stouts and porters are on tap at this food truck-loving hot spot. White got his just due last season and was named a first-team All-Pro while tying for the league lead in interceptions (six). I'll start with the two young players. He’s only raced four times at Sonoma, and has a top 10 performance, but he’s doing well this year (12th in the Cup Series standings) and has seven top-10 finishes in 15 races this year. Joe Fortenbaugh isn't picking Odell Beckham Jr. to lead the NFL in receiving yards, but he expects Kevin Stefanski's scheme to improve the wide receiver's numbers in 2020. • Heinicke's composure similar to another QB Bell's case as a scheme- and personnel-transcendent back fell apart in an ugly 2019 season, with the former Steelers playmaker averaging just 3.2 yards per carry. High School Sports. (Justin Simmons, who was one of the NFL's best safeties a year ago, is still waiting for his first Pro Bowl appearance.). Donald clinched his gold jacket when he won his second Defensive Player of the Year award. Outside of that one year, though, he has three Pro Bowl nods, no first-team All-Pro spots and a 2-5 record in the postseason. He probably needs to keep that streak going for a couple more years or rack up another 15-sack campaign to move the needle to Likely. Both players are on a streak, and their chances depend on keeping that streak going. Likely (70% to 99%): RB Ezekiel Elliott, G Zack Martin, OT Tyron Smith. The SportsLine Projection Model, which is up almost $7,900 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception, has revealed its Week 2 NFL picks Bakhtiari, likewise, is blocked by Tyron Smith. Lock (100%): DT Aaron Donald. The former Panthers quarterback has two other Pro Bowl nods besides that 2015 season, although he hasn't received a nomination since. Jones now has five consecutive seasons with at least 10 sacks. Mahomes' résumé -- a league MVP and Super Bowl MVP -- is usually enough to get a player into the Hall of Fame, let alone doing it over two seasons as a starter. I wanted to share the Chronicles with those of you who suspected the public side was only the tip of the iceberg; those who have always wondered about the person he was inside.This is by no means meant to be a definitive characterization, ... Houston probably had the best shot of these four earlier in his career, given that he made four consecutive Pro Bowls and led the league with 22 sacks in 2014, but he hasn't been dominant since dealing with a knee injury between 2015 and 2016. 3 pick. Those unable to attend the Preakness Stakes won’t miss a thing, aside from the fact that the Pimlico track’s infield is a giant party. He has made the Pro Bowl in each of his first six seasons, adding four first-team All-Pro appearances. Work to do (10% to 39%): QB Baker Mayfield, DE Myles Garrett. While Pro Bowls and All-Pro awards are hardly gospel, they're the best measure we have of how league observers valued a particular player in his time. He doesn't need that sort of individual production to make it to the Hall of Fame, but the guys who made it in without a single first-team All-Pro appearance needed something else. Likely (60% to 99%): RB Frank Gore. While Hunter's chances are probably somewhere in the 65% range, Smith is closer to the lower end of the spectrum in the 40% zone. Work to do (10% to 39%): DE Yannick Ngakoue. Mosley needs to be recognized as the best inside linebacker in the game at least a couple of times; after missing virtually all of 2019 with a groin injury, he has opted out of the 2020 season over concerns for his family's health. He needs only three more years to get to 60,000 passing yards, and if that gets Philip Rivers in, Ryan shouldn't have much trouble. Some of the lyrics are a jab at Neil Young: I hope Neil Young will remember A southern man don't need him around anyhow Young had written songs like "Southern Man" and "Alabama," which implied that people in the American South were racist and stuck in the past.Skynyrd responded with "Sweet Home Alabama," a song about Southern pride and all the good things in Alabama. What happens next is critical for Gurley, who would have seemed on the road to Canton after taking home Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2015 and adding an Offensive Player of the Year award two years later. Likely (70% to 99%): LB Khalil Mack. Gore is the football equivalent of somebody like MLB outfielder Jim Rice as a compiler who plays a position the electorate loves. 2 pick was a four-time Pro Bowler and a three-time All-Pro during his five seasons in Detroit. No offensive lineman is ever a lock when guys like Faneca still aren't enshrined, but Smith plays the most prominent position on the line for the most popular team in the league. Barr made four consecutive Pro Bowls from 2015 to 2018, but it'll be tough for him to get the first-team All-Pro votes he'll need for Canton without racking up significant sack totals. "Nuk" has been a first-team All-Pro in each of his past three seasons, which is the sort of run that earns skill-position players a trip to Canton on their own. Work to do (10% to 39%): DE DeMarcus Lawrence, DT Gerald McCoy, LB Leighton Vander Esch. Dan Orlovsky denounces the NFL Network's Top 100 players for 2020 for excluding Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz. The only eligible player with that sort of résumé who hasn't made it to Canton is Webb, and while Webb was also a left tackle, he didn't make a single Pro Bowl after turning 30.

The legendary history of the pony car wars comes to life in this softcover edition of The Cars of Trans-Am Racing.

Of the 27 Hall-eligible players who have pulled that off, 14 are enshrined. Five of the 40 defensive players chosen among the top three picks of the draft since 1970 who are eligible for the Hall are enshrined, a percentage that will rise as players like Julius Peppers and Von Miller eventually become eligible. He started his career with seven Pro Bowls in seven seasons, which is rarefied air. Wagner turned 30 in June, and after eight seasons in the league, he has ... six Pro Bowl appearances and five first-team All-Pro nominations. Over that five-year span, Landry ranks third in the NFL in catches and seventh in receiving yards. He was excellent in his third season, but since then, his production has roughly been in line with that of Robby Anderson. Moving to a higher-profile, more successful team will help Ramsey's chances of drawing national attention, although he wasn't close to Stephon Gilmore or Tre'Davious White a year ago. If Murray breaks out in Year 2, he'll be on the fast track. A Nod to the Old Fort: New Smyrna Beach Brewing Co. is just steps from – and crafts a beer to honor – the mysterious  Old Fort landmark, a 40-by-80-foot coquina ruin, reminiscent of St. Augustine's Castillo de San Marcos. Harris has four Pro Bowls and a first-team All-Pro appearance in 2016, but his play has slipped over the past couple of years, and smaller cornerbacks typically don't do well after they turn 30. The Cal product has five Pro Bowls and a first-team All-Pro appearance through his age-30 season. The People Have Spoken: Persimmon Hollow Brewing Co. fans, through a kickstarter campaign, helped two home brewers and best friends turn their dream into a very real small craft operation that now resides in the heart of historic downtown DeLand. Buckner made the Pro Bowl in 2018, but he was otherwise underappreciated during his four seasons in the Bay Area. Unlike Gurley, McCaffrey didn't win Offensive Player of the Year or make a deep playoff run. Ryan's case is trickier. Williams needs a couple of high-profile seasons as the best left tackle in football, which is tough with Tyron Smith around. News, Sports, Weather, Traffic, and the Best of Minnesota, and the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul. Work to do (10% to 39%): RB Le'Veon Bell, LB C.J. In the running (40% to 69%): RB Saquon Barkley. Join or create a league in the No. Tight ends have relatively short careers, which makes projecting their Hall chances exceedingly difficult.

Featuring the newest in the Cocoa Kids CollectionÂ© cast of multicultural characters, including âAuntieâ who we first met in Isaiah and the Chocolate MountainÂ©, and her son, âEddie,â this second work of fiction pulls readers deeper ...

The best trade Andy Reid ever made was moving up in the draft for Mahomes in 2017. • $1,500 tabs: NFL linemen dinners are back I worry a little about Atkins because he plays in a small market and in an era in which he's second fiddle to a better version of the same player (Aaron Donald), but history suggests Atkins is in. I haven't included players who I believe have no more than a 10% chance of making it into the Hall. The Hall is forgiving of running backs, and Bell's versatility should age well, but he has missed a lot of time through injuries, suspensions and his 2018 holdout. Think about that. Guy made only one Pro Bowl after turning 30, and Hekker probably needs a couple more All-Pro appearances to earn serious consideration. • Tony Dungy's advice for Arthur Smith?
