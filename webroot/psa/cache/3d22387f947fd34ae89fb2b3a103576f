Students in both programs can take advantage of Northeasternâs extensive research opportunities, co-ops, experiential network projects, and connections with faculty members who have real-world experience in their respective industries.Â Â, âOften, other schools donât offer the immersive experience that we have at Northeastern,â Booth says. Though programs may vary depending on the institution, one can expect to complete a significant amount of original research. Typically designed for individuals who have an undergraduate degree in biology, chemistry, or a similar subject, pharmacology programs introduce students to the world of drug interactions, brain chemistry, and cellular physiology. Prodrugs are usually used with the aim of increasing drug permeation by enhancing lipophilicity or water solubility. FACULTY Terms in this set (17) Biotransformation (metabolism) Occurs when the structure of the drug is chemically altered during metabolism. In fact, the majority of Northeasternâs pharmacy studentsâabout 90 percent, according to Boothâpursue jobs in pharmacies.Â, These jobs have a median annual salary of $128,090.
