Bioretention can be applied in most soils or topography, since runoff simply percolates through an engineered soil bed and is infiltrated or returned to the stormwater system via an underdrain. B. It is most always made to rigorous specification standards. made for the Regional Bioretention Soil Mix Guidance to better meet the requirements of the Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit. 0000005758 00000 n Bioretention Soil MIX (BSM) General: BSM shall be a well-blended mixture of sand and compost, shall have sufficient moisture retention to support healthy plant growth, and shall meet the following criteria: Bioretention Feasibility Criteria . The soil has to provide the correct water infiltration rate and support vegetation and healthy microorganisms. 0000053779 00000 n Compact the Bioretention Soil Mix to a relative compaction of 85 percent of modified maximum dry density (ASTM D-1557). Design Principles of Your Bioretention Cell Size and shape, soil mix, inlets and outlets, underdrains and plant selection are all important distinguishing characteristics of your bioretention cell. The default BSM specification is 60% sand and 40% compost by volume (default BSM), and it provides filtration of stormwater to achieve runoff treatment. xref “Applicant” refers to the entity proposing the soil mixture for approval by a Permittee. The BSM has a ratio of inorganic and organic materials to allow the appropriate infiltration rates for stormwater; facilitate pollutant removal through chemical, biological and physical processes; and provide a sufficient growing medium for plants. Bioretention areas are shallow landscaped depressions, with a designed soil mix and plants adapted to the local climate and soil moisture conditions, that receive stormwater from a contributing area. Bioretention Soil Media (BSM) is a formulated soil mixture that filters pollutants from stormwater, retains moisture, and supports healthy vegetation. However, improved technical reference materials are needed to determine the influence of planting soil mix design on the hydrologic and water quality performance of bioretention cells. Bioretention can be used to: • Manage the first one inch of rainfall on-site using an Infiltration Design with no underdrain (See Table BR-1, Level 2 design) 3. The above numbers are not based on data for bioretention soils. During storms, runoff temporarily ponds 6 to 12 inches above the mulch layer and then rapidly filters through the bed. 2. Place and spread soil mix over the approved subgrade. 4. The native soil is replaced with a sand/soil mix that meets minimum permeability requirements. Bioretention “cells” are shallow depressions ﬁlled with sandy soil, topped with a thick layer of mulch, and planted with dense vegetation. Bioretention Soil Media - Welcome to Owl Run Nursery... Bioretention is the process of utilizing engineered soil mix (filter media) and surface cover (plants) to remove contaminants and excess nutrients from stormwater runoff.

Many engineers claim that because a lot more stormwater runs through bioretention soils than through typical soils that are not part of a best management practice [BMP], bioretention soils will receive more fines and clog more easily – thus they should have high sand content to offset the large amounts of fines they will collect over time.
