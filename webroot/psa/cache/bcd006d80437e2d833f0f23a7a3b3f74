This challenges a previous observation by Waterston and colleagues (Waterston et al., 1992) who have described an intact predictive control of smooth pursuit in cerebellar patients. Tracking Deficit: Eyes jump . Percentage frequency of abnormal position errors of first saccades towards step-ramps and pure step displacements. A pursuit deficit in one direction suggests an ipsilesional localization, but beware of a superimposed spontaneous nystagmus; a pursuit deficit in all directions is commonly seen with cerebellar lesions People with autism show a plethora of visual deficits. For full access to this pdf, sign in to an existing account, or purchase an annual subscription. Furthermore, our results do not necessarily mean that predictive control of step-ramp pursuit is completely abolished in cerebellar patients. Observe the client following a moving object such as a pencil eraser with their head still. With respect to predictable stimuli, this could be due to a deficit in predicting the target path. In most recent models (see Keller and Heinen, 1991), smooth pursuit is driven by three distinct inputs: (i) a relatively direct retinal slip signal; (ii) an internal representation of target velocity in space, derived from processed visual and proprioceptive information (e.g. This leads to the hypothesis of correct information on the velocity of the target motion that is relayed to the cerebellum. Both types of smooth eye movements, ASEM and smooth pursuit, probably share a common predictive control mechanism that uses stored information from previous target presentations (Boman and Hotson, 1988; Kowler, 1989; Kao and Morrow, 1994; Barnes et al., 1997). VGP can affect functional eye movements by selectively involving the saccadic pathway and may spare or involve spare smooth pursuit or optokinetic movements or non-selectively involve VGP for all types of eye movements. Eye and head movement-related activity. The papers in this volume explore the latest discoveries in how the brain and the peripheral motor system generate eye movements. The following Illusions are founded on two well-known facts; namely, the persistency of impressions, and the pro-duction of complementary colours, on the retina.The explanations are divided into two Parts. It remains uncertain whether cerebellar dysfunction spares the predictive control mechanisms of pursuit initiation. 1. Harding AE. Westheimer G, Blair SM. A model of the smooth pursuit eye movement system. This book is divided in 3 parts, the first of which covers the relevant background information, including an introduction to the human visual system and key issues in visual perception and eye movement. Barton JJ, Sharpe JA, Raymond JE. Tychsen L, Lisberger SG. 3A). Of seven patients with normal visual fields for the target, two had a retinotopic eye movement deficit consisting of impaired smooth pursuit of targets moving in both . In fact, none of the patients showed any bias of the saccadic position error that was related to the direction or velocity of the ongoing target motion. In controls, target predictability did not lead to a statistically significant increase of peak eye velocity, although the data given in Fig. The target consisted of a red laser dot (diameter 5 mm) that was rear-projected and moved across the horizontal meridian by means of a low inertia two-axis mirror galvanometer. The relative frequency of hypo- and hypermetric saccades in patients was determined with reference to this normative range. Many investigators have proposed that the fundamental deficit in schizophrenia involves a failure to inhibit the saccade system, resulting in the intrusion of saccades during the smooth pursuit task (2 - 4) . Krauzlis RJ, Lisberger SG. The ramp velocity did not significantly affect smooth pursuit latency [F(1,11) = 0.6, P = 0.45]. With foveofugal step-ramps, which were presented only in the RAND condition, mean initial saccade latency was not different from visually-triggered saccades to pure step displacements [F(1,11) = 0.2, P = 0.7]. All of them showed significant cerebellar atrophy on cranial CT or MRI scans. I. Temporally directed deficits for the detection of visual motion in latent nystagmus: evidence for adaptive processing. The present clinical study analysed effects of degenerative cerebellar lesion on smooth pursuit initiation. This deficit appears to only emerge after middle adolescence. [Review]. However, in human patients, decreased velocity of ipsilateral initial pursuit has been reported recently after observations that lateral lesions of the cerebellar hemispheres seem to spare these midline areas (Straube et al., 1997). We have analyzed eye movement performances in schizophrenics showing primary negative or deficit symptoms (n=16) and non-deficit schizophrenics (n=55), and compared them with those of controls (n=34) in order to study the relationships between negative symptoms and eye movement abnormalities. This work presents further evidence that the effect of cerebellar degeneration is not limited to the impaired velocity gain of steady-state smooth pursuit. Four of the 16 patients had directional pursuit asymmetry, in which smooth eye movement velocities were reduced toward the lesion, independent of target location on the retina. This book is written for clinicians, researchers, residents and students in neurology and neuroscience. [Neurophysiological studies in autism spectrum disorders--comparison with those in schizophrenia]. I. It seems that healthy humans can use the predictive information on target direction and velocity to improve the anticipatory programming of the smooth pursuit response. Cerebellectomy leads to a complete abolition of smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys (Westheimer and Blair, 1974), suggesting that the cerebellum is required to initiate smooth pursuit. Normal ranges refer to the average final position error ±2 SD in the control group. The hereditary ataxias and related disorders. In the third condition, pure step condition (STEP), the target stepped between centre position and eccentric horizontal positions at ±7.5° and ±15.0° without any ramp target motion in between. The slope of the first regression line (1) describes any anticipatory eye acceleration, the slope of the second line (2) the initial acceleration of visually triggered pursuit. A second regression line was fitted to the 60 ms-segment that followed the point where the eye velocity exceeded the range of the first regression line by >3 SD (see Carl and Gellman, 1987; Kao and Morrow, 1994). Smooth Pursuit Pursuit is a voluntary response, controlled by attention to moving objects. Keller and Heinen, 1991). Moschner C, Zangemeister WH, Demer JL. Here, cerebellar degeneration causes a disturbed transformation of this information into the correct motor command that finally drives initial smooth pursuit eye movements. Human subjects use smooth pursuit eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of a continuously moving target. Children with autism show reduced velocity of smooth pursuit compared to controls during ongoing tracking However, the latency of the pursuit response is similar to controls. Eye movement disorder. 6. Smooth pursuit movements are conjugate eye movements (in which both the eyes move in the same direction). It may be that different predictive mechanisms are activated during these different types of pursuit tracking.       Bookshelf The latency of rightward successful antisaccades was significantly increased as compared with the latency of leftward antisaccades in deficit patients only. In neuro-ophthalmic terminology, these include horizontal and vertical conjugate gaze limitations, voluntary smooth pursuit and saccadic deficits, and involuntary conjugate gaze deviations. In healthy controls, individual mean eye acceleration ranged between 43 and 128°/s2 when triggered by predictable step-ramps, and between 44 and 124°/s2 when triggered by randomized stimuli of 20°/s ramp velocity, which is in line with previous results (Kao and Morrow, 1994). Patients were subtyped into deficit and non-deficit subgroups using the Schedule for the Deficit Syndrome. Noda H, Warabi T. Responses of Purkinje cells and mossy fibres in the flocculus of the monkey during sinusoidal movements of a visual pattern. Conclusions, Our results are consistent with the notion that the smooth pursuit gain deficit is related to a deficit in motion perception rather than in attention. It remains, therefore, unclear to what extent a cerebellar lesion affects the time required to initiate non-predictive smooth pursuit. First Published in 1988. Routledge is an imprint of Taylor & Francis, an informa company. 1988 Nov;24(7):747-61. doi: 10.1016/0006-3223(88)90250-8. 3B, the mean initial eye acceleration, averaged during the first 60 ms of visually guided smooth pursuit, was decreased in patients compared with controls [F(1,11) = 7.2, P < 0.05]. Velocity prediction in corrective saccades during smooth-pursuit eye movements in monkey. Smooth pursuits are important for following moving targets. There was only one control subject in whom mean anticipatory eye acceleration reached 5.8°/s2 in RAND trials and 8.7°/s2 in the PRED condition. Thus, cerebellar deficits of initial eye acceleration or steady-state velocity gain cannot be attributed to an abnormal velocity saturation alone. To study this question DC eye movement recordings of 52 patients with horizontal gaze-evoked nystagmus and/or smooth pursuit deficits were studied in . 4A) or pure steps did not significantly differ between controls and patients [F(1,11) = 0.9, P = 0.3]. TheVORwassymmetrical andqualitative-ly normal (fig 4D). Target steps were presented sequentially in a balanced pseudo-random order. Again, it seems that whatever the extent of the predictive cerebellar input is, it cannot be used functionally to overcome delays in pursuit initiation, and the attenuation of eye velocity and acceleration. We adopted the 0.05 significance level. It may also be due to acquired brain injury such as from a concussion. The data have been submitted to a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a between group factor (two levels, controls versus patients) and two repeated measures, target predictability (two levels, PRED versus RAND) and ramp velocity (two levels, 10°/s versus 20°/s). . Predictive input becomes most effective during repeated presentation of regular target motion. For example, during pursuit maintenance of periodic stimuli, prediction adjusts the eye velocity gain and corrects for phase lags that are due to the delays required to process visual input (Becker and Fuchs, 1985; van den Berg, 1988; Barnes and Asselman, 1991). 2012;114(4):335-48. Smooth pursuit during transient disappearance of a visual target. Schizophrenic subjects demonstrated a greater decrease in saccadic response time than did normal controls in a gap task (when the fixation point was . Histograms to show (A) mean latency, (B) mean amplitude, and (C) mean absolute value of the position error of first saccades during foveopetal step-ramps (PRED and RAND condition) and foveofugal step-ramp movements (RAND condition only). Comparison of this distribution in the same patient often revealed no consistent pattern between step-ramp trials and pure step trials. With foveofugal ramps, the step amplitude was always 3° and the ramp duration was 400 ms. With foveopetal ramps, the step size was adjusted to the ramp velocity so that the target crossed the centre position in 200 ms in order to facilitate pre-saccadic smooth pursuit by delaying the first saccade (Rashbass, 1961). Therefore, we defined a normative range for the final position error based on the data in the control group (normal range = mean position error ± 2 SD). Since the smooth pursuit system has its own premotor circuits, a smooth pursuit deficit can be either the result of a premotor smooth pursuit lesion or the consequence of a gaze-holding deficit. Histograms to show (A) mean latency, (B) mean eye acceleration of the initial smooth pursuit response, and (C) the later peak eye velocity, in the group of control subjects (stippled columns) and patients (black columns). SPEMs are generally much slower than saccades. Nawrot M, Rizzo M. Motion perception deficits from midline cerebellar lesions in human. The inherited ataxias and the new genetics [editorial].

For this condition, we used an infrared light eye-tracking device (Skalar, Delft, The Netherlands) instead of the magnetic search-coil system.

A vertical gaze palsy (VGP) is a conjugate, bilateral, limitation of the eye movements in upgaze and/or downgaze. 1 INTRODUCTION. The generation of slow ASEM in some of our cerebellar patients suggests that predictive input to their cerebellum is not completely cancelled.       Disclaimer, National Library of Medicine Since it is well known that the ability to generate fast smooth pursuit eye movements is generally impaired in most cerebellar patients (e.g. Relationship between eye acceleration and retinal image velocity during foveal smooth pursuit in man and monkey. Additionally, the data were displayed online by a pen recorder to provide the experimenter with immediate feedback of the subject's performance. In a darkened room, subjects were seated 1.5 m in front of a semi-translucent tangent screen with their head fixed. Although we have used a relative velocity threshold to determine the pursuit onset, this abnormal delay was not a secondary effect of the decreased initial acceleration since we found no positive correlation between initial acceleration and latency of pursuit in our patients (P > 0.2, linear correlation analysis using Pearson's coefficient). Saccades were identified on the basis of velocity and acceleration criteria (eye velocity >35°/s; eye acceleration >1000°/s2). Found insideSome of the best vision scientists in the world in their respective fields have contributed to chapters in this book. 1 Specific deficits of smooth pursuit eye movements represent a widely replicated intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia‐spectrum and psychotic . The major findings of this study can be briefly summarized: (i) patients with cerebellar degeneration demonstrated an abnormal decrease of eye acceleration during the first 60 ms of smooth pursuit; (ii) their smooth pursuit initiation was abnormally delayed; (iii) the predictive shortening of pursuit latency that was found in controls was not present in these patients; and (iv) the position error of first saccades towards a step-ramp target displacement was not significantly different between patients and controls. This book describes, illustrates, and shares our current understanding, evaluation, and treatments of nystagmus in infancy and childhood. The eye acceleration during pursuit initiation was represented by the slope of the second regression line. It is known from animal experiments that midline cerebellar structures, especially oculomotor vermis and caudal fastigial nuclei, control the adjustment of saccade size (Keller, 1989; Büttner and Straube, 1995) and saccadic dysmetria is a common feature of degenerative cerebellar disease (Zee et al., 1976; Baloh et al., 1986; Moschner et al., 1994). During the ongoing smooth pursuit of foveopetal step-ramps, there was a trend towards slightly larger catch-up saccades in patients compared with controls as one would expect due to their pursuit impairment, but this trend was statistically insignificant [F(1,11) = 2.5, P = 0.2]. Smooth pursuit eye movements can become jerky, with catch-up saccades leading to &quot;cogwheel&quot; pursuit, reminiscent of the ratchety limb movements in PD. The traces show the target position (T), the eye movement of a control subject (C) and patient 3 with a cerebellar lesion (P). The earlier pursuit initiation period is mainly driven by the retinal slip signal that accelerates the eye into the direction of the ongoing target motion after a short time required for visuomotor processing. Pursuit eye movements are used to follow a moving target. One such deficit is to smooth pursuit. Without knowledge of where a deficit is located in the . The proportion of trials where smooth pursuit initiation preceded the first catch up saccade was modestly higher in individuals with autism (55%) than healthy individuals (46%) [F(1,143) = 5.42, P &lt; 0.05]. As part of this disease there is disruption of fixation by square wave jerks and impairment of smooth pursuit movements. Generation of smooth-pursuit eye movements. The frequency and eye acceleration of ASEM was surprisingly low, even in healthy controls, when compared with the prior studies using predictable step-ramps (Kao and Morrow, 1994). Smooth pursuit is a voluntary task which requires both motivation and attention. Found inside – Page iThis book is an indispensable resource for students and practitioners navigating the evolving field of cerebellar motor and cognitive neurology. Note lack of smooth movement, sluggish movement, overshooting or undershooting the target, and complaints . Foveopetal step-ramps extended the period of smooth pursuit prior to the first saccade (Rashbass, 1961; Gellman and Carl, 1991). BACKGROUND Although mounting evidence supports the idea that smooth pursuit abnormality marks the genetic liability to schizophrenia, the precise ocular motor mechanism underlying the abnormality remains unknown. A deficiency of smooth pursuit may be functional in nature, in which the child fails to develop age-appropriate oculomotor skills. This was due to the fact that they were triggered by the initial step-displacement, thereby preceding any significant smooth pursuit eye movement (Gellman and Carl, 1991). A vision therapy program should focus on enhancing oculomotor accuracy and speed, as well as the ability to integrate with vergence (&quot;eye teaming&quot;) and accommodative (&quot;eye focusing&quot;) skills. If you put one finger in front of you and watch it as you slowly move it around, then you are making a smooth pursuit. 1996). Keller EL. In summary, the following converging evidence undermines abnormal motion perception as a convincing account of the smooth pursuit dysfunction in the cerebellar patients: (i) the saccadic latency in step-ramp trials was not prolonged in patients compared with controls; (ii) the patients' absolute position error of first saccades was similar to that of controls; (iii) their amplitude of first saccades increased with increasing ramp velocities; and (iv) their saccadic dysmetria during step-ramp trials was not related to the relative direction of the ramp motion. In addition to the decreased initial acceleration, we found an abnormal delay of pursuit onset in cerebellar patients, as previously described by Lekwuwa and colleagues (Lekwuwa et al., 1995) for smooth pursuit triggered by pure ramp stimuli. If cerebellar lesions had left predictive control of smooth pursuit intact, we should have found some predictive enhancement of the patients' initial eye acceleration during presentation of highly predictable step-ramps. This book is indispensable for neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists and physicians involved in the care of stroke patients.
