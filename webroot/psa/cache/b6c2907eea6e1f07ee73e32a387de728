With digital radiography, it&#x27;s possible for a general practitioner to e-mail a radiograph to a specialist for consultation while his or her patient is still in the chair. The data is captured by a two-dimensional array and creates high-resolution images, which are then combined to form a 3-D image of the bony structures. The application of this disruptive technology is on the verge of becoming standard of care in the field of pathology. Benefits of digital dental radiographs compared to traditional dental X-rays include the following: Digital radiograph start-up costs are expensive for dentists, with conservative estimates ranging from $11,000 to $15,000 for a wired sensor system (not including the cost for computers, software, and additional hardware, such as servers), to $20,000 to $50,000 for a wireless system, not including maintenance and service repairs. The good news is that the digital dental x-ray technology we use in our practice has sensors that are so responsive to low radiation that you are exposed to far less radiation than with the old film-based radiography.
