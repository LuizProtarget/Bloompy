Back in late January of 2017, when my painting shoulder was finally beginning to show signs of healing, I was feeling more optimistic that my Paris trip could actually go ahead. Is that fair? As a cast member and friend of Graham’s, how hard has it been to not have him around on-set?AM: The story of Amy and Ty has been very prominent since Heartland’s beginning.
