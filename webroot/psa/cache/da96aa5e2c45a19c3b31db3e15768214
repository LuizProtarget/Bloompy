I didn't think I'd need to include files since A) I wasn't OP and B) this seems like a fairly straightforward question on basis of "how is this supposed to make it work in Maya", not at all a bug or issue or personal program thing. 	 There's a substantially lacking feature though. Morphs and Morph animation is not displayed? I tried exporting a hierarchy, yet I was left with an empty FBX reviewer.

Only if there is a skinned mesh in the scene will FBX review show you the skeleton drawn over the mesh. The main goal of the Texture Set List window is to allow to switch from one material to one another to access the layer stack associated with each material. That sound like a uv map issue.  This works on vertices/vertex selection (not edges or faces). I import the obj and it has absolutely no texture information and I can't seem to associate the mtl with the obj even when I make a new texture. However,  now the system refuses to allow FBX files to be opened into the FBXReviewer tool as MotionBuilder opens instead.
