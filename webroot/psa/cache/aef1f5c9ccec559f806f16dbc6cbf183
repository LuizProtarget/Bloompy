ICs may, at their discretion, make exceptions to this time limitation when individuals have been invited for faculty job interviews but final decisions have not yet been made by the potential R00 institution or, rarely, because of unusual, extenuating circumstances. The 27 th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP2020) aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers, scientists, and industry professionals who are working in neuroscience, neural networks, deep learning, and related fields to share their new ideas, progresses and achievements. Describe the candidate’s potential to develop into a successful, independent investigator. With the exception of NSF-specific proposal certifications (which are submitted via the Authorized Organizational Representative  function8), these documents should be submitted via the FastLane Proposal Preparation Module. [  ]	The Project Summary may ONLY be uploaded as a Supplementary Document if use of special characters is necessary. For example, if the Center’s prior Phase I operated under a centralized funds collection model, the Lead Site of the Phase II proposal should attach the Phase I Center’s membership certification. A complete listing of NSF programs that require cost sharing is available on the NSF website at: http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student, postdoctorate and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups identified as underrepresented in the biomedical sciences (e.g., see the Notice of NIH's of Interest in Diversity). Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 – 2022. For proposals that contain a subaward(s), each subaward includes a separate budget justification that does not exceed five pages. The National Science Foundation has awarded Los Angeles Mission College with a $1.3 million grant to support efforts to increase success rates for biology majors, college officials announced today. Unless a waiver has been granted by NSF, a disqualifying conflict may exist, if a proposal involves an organization or other entity with which the potential reviewer has a connection.

NSF is responsible neither for the agreement reached nor the IP information exchanged between the academic institution and the industrial partner. The second (R00) phase will provide up to 3 years of independent research support, which is contingent on satisfactory progress during the K99 phase and an approved, independent, tenure-track (or equivalent) faculty position. Unless a substitute negotiator has been designated by the proposer/grantee, the Division of Grants and Agreements (DGA) or the Division of Acquisition and Cooperative Support (DACS) will not process a new proposal with a former employee or IPA as PI or co-PI. Normally, title is vested in the grantee organization for equipment purchased in conjunction with NSF-supported activities. In spite of recent advances, individuals from certain groups and backgrounds are underrepresented in the biomedical sciences research workforce as described in the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity. Phase I proposal. The information contained in this Guide will assist the organization in preparing documents which NSF requires to conduct administrative and financial reviews of the organization. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. Amounts and expenses budgeted also must be consistent with the proposing organization's policies and procedures and cost accounting practices used in accumulating and reporting costs.

Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). The applicant institution must have a strong, well-established record of research and career development activities and faculty qualified to serve as mentors in biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research. Note that the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide may use different naming conventions, and sections may appear in a different order than in FastLane, however, the content is the same: i. However, for those projects that require such resources at scales beyond what may be available locally, NSF supports a number of national resources.                Limited items are allowed in the Appendix. It is, however, meant to highlight certain critical items so they will not be overlooked when the proposal is prepared. If proposed, will the clinical trial experience contribute to the applicant’s research career development? Research Support: Up to $20,000 per year for the K99 phase. Junior Faculty Development, American Diabetes Association: varies: Awards support faculty up to and including assistant professor or equivalent, with 10 or less years research experience beyond terminal degree, as they establish independence as diabetes researchers. Should an award be made, the organization�s cost sharing commitment, as specified on the first year�s approved budget, must be met prior to the award end date. Indirect costs requested by consortium participants are included in the total cost limitation. See also 2 CFR � 200.438.
