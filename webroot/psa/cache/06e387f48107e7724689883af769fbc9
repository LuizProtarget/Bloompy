The perfect allrounder. The Zipp 202 Firecrest is designed for road cyclists who want to increase their climbing performance. The Zipp® 202 Firecrest Carbon Clincher retains the classic 32 mm rim depth of its predecessor though, with the Firecrest profile, now has a wider 25.4 mm max rim width. Without the constraints of rim brake caliper compatibility or brake-track requirements, the 202 Firecrest Tubeless Disc-brake wheelset open new adventures, paved or not. Zipp Round Titanium Nipple Washers for 202 Carbon Clincher Firecrest Wheels. There’s still a weight penalty with clinchers vs tubulars, about 100 grams per wheel. Think lighter weight. Zipp 30 Course Clincher Rim Brake Rear Wheel 700c 24 Spokes Xd-r Driver Body. This go-to rim-brake wheelset is, for the first time, tubeless ready. The problem is exacerbated by carbon composites, and then made more difficult again when the rim has a low profile, such as the 202. The test wheels weighed in at 1460g with rim strips and skewers. The wheel build remains unchanged for the new 202 clinchers. Sapim straight-pull spokes are used throughout, 18 spokes up front (laced radially) and 24 spokes out back (drive side, radial; non-drive side, 1-cross). External alloy nipples take care of tensioning the spokes. Engineered for speed when approaching, ascending, traversing, and descending the world's toughest mountain roads, Zipp 202 NSW is a wheelset that can only come from one place, The Nest, where the world's fastest wheels are made. don’t draw attention. Our Axial Clutch freehub mechanism is also compatible with XDR drivers. I don't really get the 202's. You certainly notice it riding down the road when you're really looking for it, alternating between pedalling and freewheeling, but on a long ride its impact is less tangible. Zipp introduced their Firecrest shape a few years ago while developing full carbon clinchers and have slowly been updating their entire wheel range with the new design. Zipp’s 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher is an all-around wheelset in every way. Then they reduced aerodynamic drag with ABLC Sawtooth™ technology and used ImPress™ graphics to ensure that nothing stood between the air flowing over the rim and the dimples made to smooth that flow. The 303 are 30 grams heavier, but more aero. Write a Review They also lack any consideration for aerodynamic performance, and indeed, the guys at Roues Artisanales found that an early iteration of Mavic’s R-Sys platform was one of the least aerodynamic wheelsets on the market. Zipp 202 Firecrest Carbon Clincher 2017 Wheelset engineered in the USA using the most advanced technology is all about aiming higher. Okay, they're not in the same league as a deep-section carbon wheelset on such terrain, but they're certainly not slow. The 202 NSW is Zipp's lightest carbon clincher wheelset and for 2017 has received the same cutting-edge NSW treatment that first appeared on the 808 and 404 wheels. Both of these hubshell design elements ensure that bearings quietly stay in place, roll faster, last longer, and provide a laterally stiffer hub. Last year at Ausbike, I was able to speak to Josh Poertner, the technical director at Zipp, about some of the hurdles they had to contend with while developing the Firecrest 202 clinchers. Our new Sawtooth dimple design consists of 12 nodes that are precisely clocked to start aerodynamic shearing at a rate of 50hz at a rider speed of 20mph. The Achilles heel of all carbon fibre wheels is braking performance. The Zipp quick release levers are an updated design and much more ergonomic than previous versions. In order for a climbing wheelset to be world beating it has to do more than simply deliver low weight; it has to deliver uncompromising performance on every level. The rear Cognition hub features the Axial freehub which dispenses with a traditional ratchet and pawl approach and instead uses magnets, which completely disengage when coasting. Zipp 202 NSW rims are laid up, molded, drilled, and built in Indianapolis, USA by Zipp technicians. About this item. Wind tunnel testing obviously played a key role in the development of the Firecrest design, as did a lot of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) modelling, and thermal imaging was crucial too. Read it's strength, weaknesses, find deals and pricing - roadbikereview.com Interestingly, Zipp spent some R&D dollars to engineer a titanium washer for the nipples to reduce the risk of galvanic corrosion that can occur when alloy comes into contact with carbon. Any issues with spoke tension? The Zipp 202 Firecrest Carbon Clincher is not only the lightest clincher in the Zipp war chest, but even as a clincher, it reigns supreme as the ultimate Zipp climbing wheel. Price is $3,100 / €2,800 / £2,369. u000b. Like the 303, 404, and 808 NSW, ImPress graphics also give the 202 NSW a distinctive stealthy look while keeping the rim as light as possible. Tell us some more about the technical aspects of the wheel? With 36 points of engagement that all interlock simultaneously, there isn't a more secure freehub mechanism on the market. 202. and much as you may hate it cyclists can help themselves more by being more in tune with whats happening... As the owner of a working pancreas I'm inclined not to bother. Based on the Intel processor family, the text simplifies and demystifies concepts that students need to grasp before they can go on to more advanced computer architecture and operating systems courses. Maybe something like this - although it's 50:50 - or even better a mini... Well-priced, stiff and durable set of road wheels ideal for the adventurer, commuter or weekend warrior, Great build quality and impressive durability, yet they don't scrimp on performance. The Zipp 202 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc-brake wheelset is all about new technology and new adventure.

Two weeks later, I swapped the 202s for a set of Mavic R-Sys SLR wheels which, at a claimed 1295g, actually weigh less than the Firecrest 202 clinchers. Combined with Zipp's supplied brake blocks, designed to work with this unique brake track, and the braking performance is very good. My training focus is currently mainly on running and swimming with low/medium focus on cycling. Clinchers are for training wheels. The new 202 is the lightest entry in the Firecrest Carbon Clincher lineup, a do-it-all classic road wheel. The braking track looked pristine and a few turns of a spoke key were all that were required to get the back wheel perfectly true, while the front wheel didn’t need any work. Terms and conditions of use. This scalloped design maintains the bearing bore diameter when high radial spoke tension is applied. How does that compare to your own feelings about it? Ten years of technology, should in theory offer improved aerodynamics. Condition: Used. 9/10 spd Rim Depth: 82mm Rim Type: Firecrest Carbon Clincher Spoke Count: 20 Weight: 920g. That innovation means the 202 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc-brake wheelset is now thru-axle compatible. These wheels are for serious cyclists who have specific performance goals.

When we gave our top engineers in The Nest advanced development lab the task of shedding more weight from our lightest carbon clincher wheelset, the 202 Firecrest, while also improving rolling friction, aerodynamics, and braking, it was a very tall order. They also designed a new brake pad that has extra channels for cooling, plus a greater surface area to disperse heat at the rim. To further improve the wheelset's rolling efficiency, the 202 NSW rim is laced to our groundbreaking Cognition™ hubset. Condition: Used. Christian Ludwig: Attersee~ISBN 3-7757-1715-3 U.S. $45.00 / Hardcover, 8.5 x 10.75 in. / 160 pgs / 130 color and 14 b&w. ~Item / February / Art While we strive to ensure that opinions expressed The combination of the low weight and the high stiffness provides very direct feedback; they encourage the bike to dart and dance up the road in a way that almost encourages you to search our more hills. The ZIPP® 202 Firecrest Carbon Clincher retains the classic 32 mm rim depth of its predecessor though, with the Firecrest profile, now has a wider 25.4 mm max rim width. Period. Buy a Zipp 202 Disc-brake Wheelset from … Zipp gave their top engineers in The Nest advanced development lab the task of shedding more weight from their lightest carbon clincher wheelset, the 202 Firecrest, while also improving rolling friction, aerodynamics, and braking, it was a very tall order.           compares with items of similar spec, quality, and price. Built around our Axial Clutch™ freehub technology, the Cognition rear hub is engineered to maintain speed when coasting by disengaging the ratchet mechanism. Matt Phillips. The Sawtooth dimple pattern, the company's latest update of its iconic golf ball dimple design, is now arranged in a way that is said to improve aerodynamics and stability, but it makes a less noticeable impact on such a shallow rim, compared with, say, a deep rim like the 404 NSW. Since the old Zipp 404 has lasted so well, I have been thinking of upgrading to the Zipp 404 Firecrest.  I was impressed with the quality of the braking. The Time-Crunched Triathlete delivers better results in less time because it leverages the power of high-intensity interval training with workouts designed specifically to make you a faster triathlete--not just a more fit endurance athlete. The recommended retail for 202 Firecrest wheels is $3299 and includes rim tape, brake pads, skewers, and inner tubes for both wheels. While most people think of the 303 Firecrest wheels as the company’s go-to wheel for cyclocross and classics, Indiana-based Zipp offers the more aerodynamic 404, as ridden by Stybar to win Worlds, and the lower-profile and lighter 202 wheels for climbing, lower speed racing, and weight weenies. We've employed Zipp's ImPress™ graphics technology, which prints graphics directly on the wheel, to help allow the dimples to do what they were designed to do – control vortex shedding, the rate at which air sheds off the wheel. The Zipp 202 Firecrest Disc-Brake wheelset will be in stores next month with an MSRP of $1,272 for the front and $1,553 for the rear. In the wet and, well, I'd love to be able to report that the braking is impressive and lives up to Zipp's 'confidence inspiring rim braking whether the road is wet or dry' – but that simply isn't the case. I recently described the role of CFD in the development of Bontrager’s Aeolus D3 rims, where computer modelling allowed engineers to test different rim shapes in a virtual wind tunnel rather than constructing an actual prototype. There is certainly no mistaking them for cheaper wheels, which is a good thing if you're rich enough to afford them. The 635 gram 202 Firecrest Clincher wheel is light, laterally stiff, and cleanly aerodynamic. The 202s cornered well, they felt fast while descending, and they were never troubled by crosswinds, just like any good set of low-profile wheels. No qualms battering them over the roughest Cotswolds roads. When Zipp decided the time had come to take their climbing specific wheel, the 202, a wheel that’s won more mountain stages than Michele Ferrari’s address book, and make it in a new Firecrest carbon clincher something unexpected popped out of the mold. With less internal hub drag a rider can pedal less when riding through rolling hills or drafting in a headwind. Its speed, light weight and utter reliability have been proven in pro cycling’s most demanding races and has now been completely redesigned with Firecrest shaping. Every time a conventional hubset starts to coast, friction within the freehub ratchet mechanism works like a drum brake to slow the rider down.  Therefore it is more drawn on a deeper section Carbon rim, and a silicon coating., because fortunately good products are more common than bad unmatched stopping power and endurance cycling focus start. ’ t sit still long enough to – they ’ re too busy innovating bearings smooth.
