Two drugs, atropine and pralidoxime, can be given for exposure to a nerve agent. Nelson said spending time and money to approve midazolam is crucial, "because for nerve agent [exposure], atropine is not really the operative agent" in treating people.

Bookshelf De Bretton-Gordon said last month that exposure to a nerve agent is a "very toxic and a horrible way to die." Exposure to Organophosphates. Atropine is one of the preferred antidotes for nerve gas exposure. A preparation of concentrated atropine for injection from atropine powder is the ideal solution, but the stability of this preparation is unknown. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0194236. The extended shelf-life allows the preparation to be readily available in the field as required.

Neurotoxicity of Pesticides, Volume Four, in this comprehensive serial addresses contemporary advances in neurotoxicology of pesticides by providing authoritative review articles on key issues in the field. Atropine should not be administered for preventive purposes prior to contemplated exposure to "nerve gas," as this may increase respiratory absorption of "nerve gas" by in- hibiting bronchoconstriction and bronchial secretion. Acetylcholine builds up and continues to make the nerves connect over and over and over again. This prevents acetylcholine from binding to the receptors and sending impulses to the muscles. There is also generally no benefit … McDonough JH. All solutions remained clear and colorless, and the pH changed only slightly over the study period. In case of nerve gas exposure, military personnel are issued injectors containing atropine and pralidoxime What symptoms would It is only effective if taken prior to exposure and in conjunction with Atropine and Pralidoxime, issued in the Mark I NAAP autoinjector, and is ineffective against other nerve agents.

That way, even though the chemical attack causes an overabundance of acetylcholine in a victim's brain, the receptors do not pick up the signals and the person's nervous system has a chance to even itself out. "The important thing is to get the atropine in as quickly as possible," Khare says. In case of nerve gas exposure, military personnel are issued injectors containing atropine and pralidoxime What symptoms would This book is an accessible and authoritative guide to the practical medical management of victims of chemical warfare and offers an explanation of the underlying pharmacology and toxicology of the various agents. 2-PAM chloride cleaves the nerve agent from the cholinesterase enzyme and restores the enzyme’s activity.

When is it used    The copious secretions, which may be thickened by atropine, also impede ventilatory efforts and require frequent suctioning. Sarin Exposure: A Simulation Scenario, South Med J. The AtroPen® (atropine)  Auto-injector is indicated for the treatment of poisoning    by susceptible organophosphorous nerve agents having cholinesterase activity    as well as organophosphorous or carbamate insecticides. Midazolam: An Improved Anticonvulsant Treatment for Nerve Agent Induced Seizures. The name nerve agents come from its ability to affect the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. How is sarin gas treated? Nerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents. Essentially, when the body is working normally, a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine moves between nerves to carry signals. Previous and recent data has shown that even when atropine is administered in doses higher than traditional cholinergic toxicity doses, it has not been shown to cause toxicity in small children and infants. "Since the Tokyo Sarin Subway Attack, the threat of chemical warfare agents has migrated from the battlefield to become a major concern for homeland security in the 21th century. 2003 Apr;41(4):453-6. doi: 10.1067/mem.2003.103.
