For those that have learned the skill of Carabiner Wrap Rappelling, this is old news.Â Â  For those that have no clue, this is how it is done.Â  You take a 12 foot piece of static rope or climbing rope and make a swiss seat (military version of a harness).Â  You put one snaplink (military term for Carabiner) through the swiss seat so that the gate is facing you and the open end of the snap link is facing up.Â  With double ropes you put both strands of rope into the snap link, wrap it once around the spine of the snap link and into the gate once more.Â  Using leather gloves, you are now ready to rappel.Â  In the old days the Army used snap links that were steel ovals marked Wyott and a number like 69, 70, 72, 73, and so on indicating the name of the manufacturer and the year of manufacture.Â  These snap links did the job, they were not locking but make to flex just enough to catch the pin of the gate and “lock” the gate when ever the snap link was loaded.Â  They held a force of over 2,000 pounds.Â Â  Today, the Army has switched to 7/16 inch Omega steel snap links with a 51 kilo newton strength rating (over 11,000 pounds), making rappelling with this system much safer. 19.95.
