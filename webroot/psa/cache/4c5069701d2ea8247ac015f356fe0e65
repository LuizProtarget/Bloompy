A 100Ah battery at 20 hours means it can produce 5 Amps for 20 hours (100/20 = 5). In an off-grid system, everything comes and goes from the battery bank, so your solar batteries will be working hard. This is thanks to ticker active lead plates in the battery, higher amounts of active paste and thicker glass mat separators, which enable the user to discharge the battery up to an 80% depth of discharge (DOD). Our range of AGM Batteries are "recombinant" - what that means is that the Oxygen and Hydrogen will recombine INSIDE the battery. Deep cycle batteries aren’t designed to deliver high currents to start a car. T2 technology. Valve Regulated Lead-Acid Batteries ( VRLA ), Battery Power For Pop Up Campers (Battery Guide). You will find that the plates in an AGM Battery are flat like wet cell lead-acid batteries, or they may be wound into a tight spiral. These discharges occur without harming themselves a bit.

Even though maintenance is relatively easy and quick, there is a lot of it. Gel batteries eliminate electrolyte precipitation and discharge (and eventual complications of erosion) typical to wet cell batteries. You want to ensure that the electrolyte amount is where it should be, particularly for flooded batteries. All Wisdom Power Deep Cycle Batteries are constructed using battery electrolyte (acid) that is contained in the glass mats (AGM), so they cannot spill, even if broken. 1. Gel batteries a deep cycle durability that allows you discharge them up to 90% and still get a much better cycle life compared to AGM batteries. Johnny Kennedy from Century Batteries takes you through how to test deep cycle batteries and the different methods that can be used. These RV batteries have a mix of starting and deep cycle battery properties. The battery can be mounted in any orientation and does not need constant maintenance, unlike the flooded deep-cycle battery. The life cycle or lifetime of lead-acid batteries compared to lithium batteries, is really where lithium far outshines lead-acid. It charges a battery in phases and protects it against overcharging. Depth of discharge determines how much of the battery can be discharged safely compared to its original capacity, before it must be recharged. 			5 Star Reviews – Customer Feedback that shows the quality of our product.
