For example, if we want to find the instantaneous velocity at t = 5, we would just substitute &quot;5&quot; for t in the derivative ds/dt = -3 + 10. Express your answer in meters per second squared. O m/s2  Example : 8 Time-velocity graph of a particle is shown in figure. Ans similarly put t = 0 , x = 0 again differentiate dx/dt = v dx/dt = d(t²)/dt - 6d(t)/dt = 2t - 6 now put t =0 v = -6 moving in negative direction this indicate speed is decreasing now check when speed will be zero for this put v = 0 then 2t - 6 =0 or t =3s hence at 3s particle speed will be zero for distance put t = 3s  All three charges have the same magnitude ...
