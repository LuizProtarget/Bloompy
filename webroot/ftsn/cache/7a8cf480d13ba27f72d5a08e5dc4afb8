[39] In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn. The following represents all participants in the war. Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions. With the passage of the British North America Act, 1867 by the British Parliament, the Province of Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of international relations. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer Units, with over 82,000 soldiers. During this period the Commonwealth built an enormous military and industrial capacity. The image of imperial strength in Asia had been shattered by the Japanese attacks, and British prestige there was irreversibly damaged. Found insideAs historian Martin Gilbert demonstrates in this “majestic opus” of historical synthesis, the twentieth century can be said to have been born on that fateful morning in June of 1914 (Publishers Weekly, starred review). “One of the ... The episode had major political consequences, helping to persuade the government of Scotland of the merits of turning the personal union with England into a political and economic one. The British Empire was composed of the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. [58], During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. [95][96], Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's "imperial century" by some historians,[97][98] around 10 million sq mi (26 million km2) of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire. [240] Under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1860 Convention of Peking, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula had been respectively ceded to Britain in perpetuity, but the majority of the colony consisted of the New Territories, which had been acquired under a 99-year lease in 1898, due to expire in 1997. Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped accelerate the decline of the empire. [13] The first Canadian convoy of 15 ships bearing war goods departed Halifax just six days after the nation declared war, with two destroyers HMCS St. Laurent and HMCS Saguenay. Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815) and Heligoland. The original edition of twenty chapters, was written in pencil in twenty school exercise books in 1921, probably to help exorcise the horrendous experiences Private Lynch had witnessed during his three years at war from mid-1916 until his ... 14 August 2020. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command. West African soldiers from the former British colonies of Nigeria, Gold Coast (now Ghana), Sierra Leone and Gambia were crucial in winning the jungle war in Burma, fighting in appalling conditions to defend India from being overrun by Japan in World War II. [119], The Dutch East India Company had founded the Cape Colony on the southern tip of Africa in 1652 as a way station for its ships travelling to and from its colonies in the East Indies. Britain's sterling balances around the world amounted to £3.4 billion in 1945 or the equivalent of about $US 200 billion in 2016 dollars. Czechoslovakia and Austria don&#x27;t count because they had already been taken over by Germany. Initially the Canal was opposed by the British;[124] but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the "jugular vein of the Empire". [33] In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas. [56] In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the Presidency Armies, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys, led by British officers. Amid the fighting, British forces continued to withdraw from Israel, with the last British troops departing from Haifa on 30 June 1948. [29], Africa was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. With textiles becoming the larger trade, by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch. The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union. [256] The British choice of system of measurement, the imperial system, continues to be used in some countries in various ways. Settlers in Ireland from Great Britain have left their mark in the form of divided nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland. [54], In the East Indies, British and Dutch merchants continued to compete in spices and textiles. 165,000 West Africans served, including 126,000 Nigerians, over 15,000 died and 30,000 . ; 2: Official figures. This book discusses the decision to use the atomic bomb. Libraries and scholars will find it a necessary adjunct to their other studies by Pulitzer-Prize author Herbert Feis on World War II. Originally published in 1966. Britain gained control of Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq, parts of Cameroon and Togoland, and Tanganyika. [173][174], For Churchill, the entry of the United States into the war was the "greatest joy". Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852. [37], Serious tension erupted over American support for independence for India, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. [236] The British Parliament had the power to pass laws extending to Canada at Canadian request. Troops from Britain and its empire fought in both the European and Pacific theatres in all . Canadians viewed the Battle of Vimy Ridge in a similar light. Royal Navy and RFC/RAF casualties were 16,862.

[130], British gains in Southern and East Africa prompted Cecil Rhodes, pioneer of British expansion in Southern Africa, to urge a "Cape to Cairo" railway linking the strategically important Suez Canal to the mineral-rich south of the continent. The British Empire provided refuge for religiously persecuted continental Europeans for hundreds of years. [46] Although England eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system[47] and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Walker, David. [147] The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates. [16] On 13 June 1940 Canadian troops deployed to France in an attempt to secure the southern flank of the British Expeditionary Force in Belgium. On July 16, 1940, Hitler issued a directive ordering the preparation and, if necessary, the execution of a plan for the invasion of Great Britain. [28] About 80,000 British, Australian and Indian troops became prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken by the Japanese in the Malayan campaign. In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire. [143], The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. The Order of the British Empire Chapel At the east end of the Crypt is the OBE Chapel, also known as St Faith&#x27;s Chapel. By the end of the war in August 1945, British Commonwealth forces were responsible for the civil and/or military administration of a number of non-Commonwealth territories, occupied during the war, including Eritrea, Libya, Madagascar, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Italian Somaliland, Syria, Thailand and portions of Germany, Austria and Japan.
