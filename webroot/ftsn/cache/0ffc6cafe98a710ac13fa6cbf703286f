I’ve been in a situation similar to this before… The solution that ended up working for us was setting a “status updates” meeting for the last 15 minutes of the work day, every day. That’s one of the reasons hospital-acquired infections are so common. How many office dramas could be avoided if we all avoided escalations of smugness? **I also rarely get too sick to work, I’m extremely fortunate, but I take all 5 sick days per year offered to me. He's now asked I don't cc … What I find very odd is the manager wants OP to wait for her to weigh in on every single issue. I’m glad my former Sociopath Boss found a new job after she got fired from where I was working. In the Conditional Formatting dialog box, click Add.. It seems you have a XY problem here. The real problem is that your boss doesn't(or cannot realistically) stay upto date on all of your work. Attack... Hyde). Any tiny milestone reached -Yay they don’t check stamp alignment anymore!- is my personal private victory/milestone to internally celebrate. For something at the level of post Doctor sure. But I guess it depends on the industry and the info in question. So Bob would need report x from Wakeen every week, Bob would have to request the report from Bob’s boss Joe (another Director), then Joe could request the report from Boss who would ask Wakeen to send Boss report x. Side not I’m fairly lower level which I think it’s important as opposed to more senior level people. Especially since some places don’t give the assistants the actual authority they need to make people do what makes their job and therefore the boss’s job easier. I aim for 4-6 weeks before the deadline when possible, but that’s probably on the more generous side. Our division is extremely dysfunctional. That's all. I once replied to an email from a client where he asked a question and I answered it. Everyone yelled at her enough for that one that she decided she should maybe start using sick days, but she had a hard time changing her mindset. No, there were no chairs or stools allowed. Just your brief note to Alison makes clear that you are a kind and conscientious student with professional-level writing chops. You figure that this will give your boss an opportunity to correct you if she doesn’t agree with your course of action. I had ex-bosses who basically told me to write the recommendation letter for them, and then they will check and sign on it. After a while, I just gave in and stopped wondering, because she insisted it was “the way it’s always been.” (She did this with everyone in the department.) OP#1 – I can feel your pain. The account managers at my company all have a few of their coworkers with delegated access to their emails so they’re always covered if they call out sick or go on vacation. Since I don’t want to clutter up your inbox needlessly, I was hoping to get a better idea of why, so I can ensure you’re copied on the right emails going forward.” Then, if it’s just about being kept in the loop, you could offer to send a summary / update email just to him with details of verbal conversations (instead of copying him on an email you’d rather not send anyhow), and if it’s about something else, you can discuss other strategies. How can they even function? If you are unsure who should be Cc:’d run it by your manager or supervisor first. No, it’s not normal to need to cc your manager on every single email you send. You do not count on him knowing the contents of these e-mails. ‘Hey Fergus! I teach at a small school (so no TA’s, even for labs; max 18 students per class) so I know all of my students by name by around the third week of the term. Don’t get your hopes up too high — I had a carbon copy of your terrible manager, she never got tired of being CC’d; she just simply stopped reading any of her email past page 1 and accumulated over 30,000 messages by the time I finally had to quit this past May…some … Tell me when the deadline is and ask if/when I’d like a reminder. Finally, be sure to give them clear info on what to do with your reference (submit it online at link? Another university instructor here. It was like I was acting the part of someone who would smile and nod at the awful manager’s insane micromanaging, and I just tried to be as dispassionate as possible because I knew whatever I did would be pulled apart or discarded or changed at the last minute. When she returns to the office I’ll then fill her in with what happened in person. Because if a situation is time sensitive your boss really only has three choices. There were no “sick days” for me from school when I was a kid unless she thought I was truly sick. #1 All my sympathy. I hope you have photos of the centerpiece hat! I’ve learned you can’t win, even if you copy her on an email I get blamed for not “picking up the phone and calling me” or sending an engraved telegram. and the “because” should be an actual reason, not “because this is the way we’ve always done it.” That kind of explaination makes you look like an idiot who blindly follows rather than a capable manager with real authority. But this cc … Those need to be protected and not exposed. How should I proceed.’ Every time the director is not available and work needs done, contact the director’s boss for instructions. The answer to “who gave you the right?” is “the entire system of employment and its customs and norms.”, It’s really, really normal for professors and managers to give references. Don’t offer to draft something, apart from anything else the tone may sound too much like your own in the cover letter and the employer might think you faked it! Well, I also keep pretty detailed notes of critical information in shared systems that my coworkers can access. That’s great. OP does that help any? The Workplace Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for members of the workforce navigating the professional setting. brooms don’t really do much except push the dirt around So why are you asking me? But yeah, I’d absolutely never ever work for her again. Frankly, the fact that she’s even assessing whether or not she thinks someone is sick enough to get to use sick leave is a really toxic and hostile attitude toward a benefit that employers should (but often don’t) want their employees to use. Maybe something like, “I’ll start working on this at 7am and plan to _______________.” And if appropriate add “unless I hear from you that you want something different”. When they finally got rid of them, the new department head had to basically do deprogramming and reassure career professionals that she did not actually need to have any input into the day-to-day minutia that the former one lived for (and bottlenecked). If you’re REALLY ill, the school hosp can call (or ideally take care of me till she could be arsed to answer the phone and show up). I have to constantly read outside resources (like this blog!) If I know the details of the opportunity and how they’re pitching themselves, I can write a letter better tailored to support them. Given below is an example of the use of CC in a business letter, which will help you better understand how it is used. I started rereading each email three to four times hoping there was nothing minor for her to jump on. And multiply your chance by directing to the customer service manager or director personally if you find out their mail address. At Hair Cuttery Family of Brands, you are not just a Hairstylistyou are a Salon Professional! Also, if I don’t reply to your email within 24 hours two weeks before your deadline, don’t call my boss and email my coworkers to get me to respond. Usually, micromanaging is a consequence of distrust. But if they stayed home that would mean scrambling for childcare or that my patients would all need to reschedule, so…. Let’s just say, she micromanaged in more ways than one. It does suck to have to explain why I can’t do certain things, because it’s often followed by “but you’re so young!! I did have to train my team out of copying me on everything because their former manager (who was a wingnut) was a micro-manager and demanded to be copied on everything. I went overboard on everything. Writing the odd reference letter is actually something I miss since I moved from teaching high school to junior high. It doesn’t sound as though you hate her and are conspiring against her. Great idea! Salon Professionals provide guests with a world-class hair experience starting from the moment they step into our salons offering a … Watch bcc though! I talked to him a few days later, asking if he was okay with the volume of emails he was receiving and he said I understood correctly and to keep it up. You’re not being dense. But it works for me and the type of work I do. I’m just getting the knack of commenting (frequent lurker on the site- rare commenter).
