So the heat energy obtained from the earth’s crust is called geothermal energy. Includes a half-page subject index. Annotation copyright by Book News, Inc., Portland, OR Archaeological evidence shows that the first human use of geothermal resources in North America occurred more than 10,000 years ago with the settlement of Paleo-Indians at hot springs. Still, this was enough to serve the electrical energy needs of over three million households. The water that is extracted with this well is around 70°C. Heat pump operation is produced by geothermal energy in 24 countries. Geothermal Energy Is Unable to Produce Around the Clock Electricity. How is it used? Unlike solar and wind energy, geothermal plants can create electricity around the clock. California gets six percent of its electricity from geothermal energy… Exploration and reserves, storage, imports and exports, production, prices, sales. Lesson plans, science fair experiments, field trips, teacher guide, and career corner. Forms EIA uses to collect energy data including descriptions, links to survey instructions, and additional information. Today, many hot springs are still used for bathing, and many people believe the hot, mineral-rich waters have health benefits. Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. Geothermal energy is produced by heat energy stored within the Earth (“geo” = Earth, "thermal" = heat). Geothermal features in national parks, such as geysers and fumaroles in Yellowstone National Park, are protected by law. In 1994, geothermal energy produced 18 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity, or 0.3 percent of the electricity used in this country. endstreamendobj110 0 obj<>/Metadata 13 0 R/OpenAction 111 0 R/PageLayout/SinglePage/PageMode/UseThumbs/Pages 107 0 R/StructTreeRoot 24 0 R/Type/Catalog/ViewerPreferences<>>>endobj111 0 obj<>endobj112 0 obj<>/ExtGState<>/Font<>/ProcSet[/PDF/Text/ImageC]/XObject<>>>/Rotate 0/StructParents 0/Thumb 11 0 R/TrimBox[0.0 0.0 612.0 792.0]/Type/Page>>endobj113 0 obj<>stream Includes hydropower, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and ethanol.
