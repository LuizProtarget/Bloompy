When you run your application, look for warnings from the JVM about obsolete VM options. Oracle Corporation and its affiliates will not be responsible for any loss, costs, or damages incurred due to your access to or use of third-party content, products, or services, except as set forth in an applicable agreement between you and Oracle. The removal of rt.jar and similar files leads to issues in these areas: In JDK 9, ClassLoader.getSystemResource doesn’t return a URL pointing to a JAR file (because there are no JAR files). If there are two versions of JDK or JRE installed, one with the new version-string format introduced in JDK 9, and the other with the older version format, then there will be two different Java-related CurrentVersion strings in the registry. Makes it easier to create instances of collections and maps with small numbers of elements. See JEP 260: Encapsulate Most Internal APIs. Oracle won’t provide commercial support or updates for Java 9 and Java 10. See Enable Logging with the JVM Unified Logging Framework in Java Platform, Standard Edition Tools Reference. Where to obtain the java.time classes? Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes. Two classes, org.omg.stub.javax.management.rmi._RMIConnection_Stub, and org.omg.stub.javax.management.rmi._RMIConnection_Tie, aren’t generated. No other rights are granted to the U.S. Government. The modularization of the Java SE Platform brings many benefits, but also many changes. The javac compiler and java launcher will exit if either one is detected. The JDK image contains the extra tools and libraries that have historically been found in the JDK. A major release contains new features and changes to existing features, which are planned and announced well in advance. See the CompactStrings option of the java command in Java Platform, Standard Edition Tools Reference. Java 8 Features. Modern applications are typically deployed through Java Web Start (with a JNLP file), native OS packaging systems, or active installers. Having understood the baggage Java 11 comes with, lets now analyze the important features in Java 11 for developers. Oracle won’t provide commercial support or updates for Java 9 and Java 10. This section includes macOS-specific features that have been removed in JDK 9. See Ergonomic Defaults for G1 GC and Tunable Defaults in Java Platform, Standard Edition Java Virtual Machine Guide for more information about tuning G1 GC. These technologies have their own methods to manage the JREs needed by finding or downloading and updating the required JRE as needed. For example, if you run jdeps on a class that calls sun.misc.BASE64Encoder, you’ll see: If you use Maven, there’s a jdeps plugin available. JEP 320: Remove the Java EE and CORBA Modules. Found inside – Page 69Potentially, deprecated features will be removed in future versions of the JDK. I use it here only for illustration purposes. Perhaps the reason that this ... Improves the API for controlling and managing operating system processes. Javadoc enhancements include the following: a simplified Doclet API, Javadoc search, support for generating HTML5 output, and support for documentation comments in module systems. If possible, use the new --release flag instead of the -source and -target options. Found inside – Page 247Java 8 and Android 5 Edition Jeff Friesen ... Listing 6-8 declares an Employee class with a name field that has been deprecated. ... Listing 6-9. If needed, cross-compile to an older release of the platform using the new –release flag in the javac tool. If this is software or related documentation that is delivered to the U.S. Government or anyone licensing it on behalf of the U.S. Government, then the following notice is applicable: U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS: Oracle programs, including any operating system, integrated software, any programs installed on the hardware, and/or documentation, delivered to U.S. Government end users are "commercial computer software" pursuant to the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency-specific supplemental regulations. The Java SE 16 ( JSR 391) specification documents changes to the specification made between Java SE 15 and Java SE 16 that include the identification of deprecated APIs and features not described here. If the JDK is installed, the Java Development Kit key replaces the Java Runtime Environment key in the above example. Allow the diamond with anonymous classes if the argument type of the inferred type is denotable. Modern applications are typically deployed using Java Web Start (JNLP), native OS packaging systems, or active installers. The command-line flag -XX:+UseParNewGC no longer has an effect. Removal Of Deprecated APIs and JavaFX. The following command-line flags have been removed: The command line flag -XX:+UseParNewGC no longer has an effect. To fix this error, remove the lib/endorsed directory, or unset the java.endorsed.dirs system property. You can use a new tool, jdeprscan, to scan a class library (JAR file) for uses of deprecated JDK API elements. Removed Classes and Methods In Java SE 9, Oracle Corp has enhanced @Deprecated annotation to provide more information about deprecated API and also provide a Tool to analyze an application’s static usage of deprecated APIs. Supports SHA-3 cryptographic hash functions as specified in NIST FIPS 202. The tools in JDK 8 support three profiles, compact1, compact2, and compact3. Code that uses only official Java SE Platform APIs and supported JDK-specific APIs should continue to work without change. This software or hardware and documentation may provide access to or information about content, products, and services from third parties. This section includes issues that appear only when deploying an application. Some security-related defaults have changed in JDK 9. See the method Thread.onSpinWait. JEP 214: Remove GC Combinations Deprecated in JDK 8, JDK 9 Release Notes - Removed APIs, Features, and Options, Enable Logging with the JVM Unified Logging Framework, http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaseproducts/. Modifies the default keystore type from JKS to PKCS12. A JDK Enhancement Proposal (JEP) is a proposal to design and implement a nontrivial change to the JDK. If true, the deprecated element is going to be removed as soon as the next major release. JDK 9 lets you choose the modules that are used at compile and run time. Run the command jdeps -jdkinternals to determine if your code uses internal JDK APIs. The following error means that your system is configured to use the extension mechanism: You’ll see a similar error if the java.ext.dirs system property is set. The ParNew flag can be used only with CMS and CMS requires ParNew. The following additional standard algorithms are supported by the java.security.MessageDigest API: SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512. Keep in mind that jdeps is a static analysis tool, and static analysis of code doesn’t tell you everything. This guide will help you migrate your application to Oracle JDK 9. This section includes changes to garbage collection in JDK 9. For example, under the old scheme, the Java 9u5 security release would have the version string 1.9.0_5-b20. Other names may be trademarks of their respective owners. This module system: Improve G1 Usability, Determinism, and Performance, Implements many new features introduced in the, Introduces a new optional phase, link time, which is in-between compile time and run time, during which a set of modules can be assembled and optimized into a custom runtime image; see the, Introduces the modular JAR file, which is a JAR file with a, Introduces the JMOD format, which is a packaging format similar to JAR except it can include native code and configuration files; see the. java. For example, a few early adopters have noticed that their dates and currencies are formatted differently. If the VM fails to start, then look for removed options, because some VM flags that were deprecated in JDK 8 have been removed in JDK 9. You can see the status of the testing of many Free Open Source Software (FOSS)  projects with OpenJDK builds at Quality Outreach on the OpenJDK wiki. Defines a new URI scheme for naming modules, classes, and resources stored in a runtime image without revealing the internal structure or format of the image. A low-pause collector such as G1 GC should provide a better overall experience, for most users, than a throughput-oriented collector such as the Parallel GC, which is the JDK 8 default. As such, use, duplication, disclosure, modification, and adaptation of the programs, including any operating system, integrated software, any programs installed on the hardware, and/or documentation, shall be subject to license terms and license restrictions applicable to the programs.

Deprecated method org.sonar.plugins.java.api.tree.TryStatementTree.resources() has been removed, in favor of org.sonar.plugins.java.api.tree.TryStatementTree.resourceList(), as Java 9 allows other trees than VariableTree to be placed as resources in try-with-resources statements. These methods return an instance of CompilationUnitTree, which represents ECMAScript code as an abstract syntax tree. The bootstrap class loader is still built-in to the Java Virtual Machine and represented by null in the ClassLoader API. See Use CLDR Locale Data by Default. By specifying modules with the new --limit-modules option, you can obtain the same APIs that are in the compact profiles. The Garbage-First Garbage Collector (G1 GC) is the default garbage collector in JDK 9. Java Platform, Standard Edition Oracle JDK 9 Migration Guide, Release 9. A few sun.

UTF-8 is a much more convenient way to represent non-Latin characters. If one exists, then download and install the new version. IDEs and other development tools require the ability to enumerate the class and resource files stored in a runtime image, and to read their contents directly by opening and reading rt.jar and similar files. See jlink in Java Platform, Standard Edition Tools Reference. If you must use an internal API that has been made inaccessible by default, then you can break encapsulation using the --add-exports command-line option. The com.sun.image.codec.jpeg package was added in JDK 1.2 as a nonstandard way of controlling the loading and saving of JPEG format image files. For example, you can start Jython in the following way: This time, the warning is not issued because the java invocation explicitly acknowledges the reflective access. ParNew can only be used with CMS and CMS requires ParNew. JNLP files let you specify complex comparisons.

Cannot be used to package applications with an earlier release of the JRE. Java Annotations allow us to add metadata information into our source code, although they are not a part of the program itself. See JEP 272: Platform-Specific Desktop Features. Use the Java Image I/O API instead. Scripting on this page enhances content navigation, but does not change the content in any way. Leverages the jlink tool to create smaller packages. Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. In previous releases, ISO-8859-1 encoding was used when loading property resource bundles. Deprecates the Applet API, which is becoming less useful as web browser vendors remove support for Java browser plug-ins. On top of that, there are new language features. Custom configurations that contain only a specified set of modules and their required modules. The Deprecated API page identifies all deprecated APIs including those deprecated in Java SE 16.
