Green Lantern (Alan Scott) and Power Girl restrained Black Adam as they dragged him into the lightning's path, but the resulting blast tears him from their hands.[9].  Realizing that Isis is powerful enough to free him from the tower, Faust agrees to help Adam locate the pieces of the amulet. The Lego Batman Movie: Joker | Harley Quinn | Phantom Zone Criminals (Zod, Sauron, Kraken, Lord Voldemort, Jaws & Gremlins) | Catwoman | Poison Ivy | Two-Face | Bane | Riddler With the help of the mind-controlling powers of the Psycho-Pirate, Luthor is able to control Adam and have him call down the Shazam magic lightning bolt to fuel the apparatus. The canon version of Black Adam appeared only once during Fawcett's initial publication run of Captain Marvel comics. [16] Dr. Sivana later uses his new-found magic eye inside of some ruins to read a magically hidden hieroglyph that makes the wall explode, releasing Black Adam from his tomb. Mim believes herself to be the greatest wizard of all time, but her magic is rivaled by her nemesis, Merlin. Joker | Music Meister | Catwoman | Penguin | Mr. Anti-Monitor | Adam can use the lightning bolt as a weapon by dodging it and allowing it to strike an opponent or target. 	 Professor Ivo | Circe | With help from Aquaman, Adam formulates a plan to channel the Rock of Eternity's magic into the Trident of Poseidon and strike down Brainiac's shields, opening him up to normal attack. Lex Luthor | Joker | Harley Quinn | Riddler | Two-Face | Catwoman | Bane | Penguin | Poison Ivy | Scarecrow | Captain Boomerang | Clayface | Mad Hatter | Ra's al Ghul | Killer Croc | Bane | Killer Moth | Mr. Gzptlsnz |  Adam then went on to save Kahndaq from the Seven Deadly Sins before vanishing. Black Adam first appeared as a one-time villain for the first issue of Fawcett Comics' The Marvel Family comic book (December 1945). Poison Ivy | Featured roles in such comic book series as Justice Society of America (JSA), Villains United, Infinite Crisis, and 52 have elevated the character's prominence in the DC Universe. Mr. Imperiex | Simon Hurt | On Black Adam's part, he was taken down by Jakeem Thunder and Johnny Thunderbolt. Planeteer | Peter Creedy is head of the secret police, "the Fingermen". Kobra | Their mother, the Queen Nancy, was the Skullgirl seven years ago. When a young orphan Billy Batson finds himself transformed into the World's Mightiest Mortal whenever he says the magic word "Shazam!," he must use his extraordinary abilities to face an invasion of alien creatures and stop mad scientist Dr ... Hellgrammite | It centers around the story of Aman, a Kahndaqi boy who was thrust into abuse and slavery long ago. [9] Left mortal, Adam wandered the Middle East, attempting to guess the word that would restore his power. He then destroys the machine so it cannot be used against him, much to Sivana's annoyance. Superboy-Prime | Angered by this betrayal, Shazam renames his errant champion Black Adam and—unable to revoke the powers he gave Adam—banishes him to the most distant star in the universe. 		 Anti-Green Lantern Corps | After the end of the battle, Black Adam is found by the Greek god, Ares. Phantasm | She manages to lead an all assault on Mount Olympus, overwhelming and destroying Zeus, in the process. Calculator | Catman | Black Adam is immune from prosecution when the Regime fell, allowing him to bide his time, rescue Wonder Woman from Themyscira, and train Supergirl, a Kryptonian he found conserved in her space ship, away from the prying eyes of Batman. Defeat the Insurgency and anyone who stands in the way (both failed). Wizard | From Le Chiffre's encounter with Bond in the original Casino Royale novel in 1953 to Raoul Silva's scheme to exact revenge on M in the 2012 film, Skyfall, Bond's foes have been one of the most important reasons for the book and film series' continued popularity. Ben Solo was a human male Force-sensitive who fell to the dark side of the Force as Kylo Ren, master of the Knights of Ren and eventual Supreme Leader of the First Order, but returned to the light side shortly before his death. He tells Faust that if he crosses him, he will come after them. Lex Luthor | He makes his lightning strike Cap, turning him back to Billy, then seizes him and covers his mouth before he can finish saying his magic word. The Wonderland Gang | Crazy Quilt | Professor Pyg | Carmine Falcone | Much later, Adam appears alongside Superman and his gathered forces to battle Batman's Insurgency at Stryker's. Vertigo | Deadshot | Demons Three | Freeze | Thomas Elliot Created by Otto Binder and C.C Beck, the character is the archenemy of the superhero Shazam, also once known as Captain Marvel. Black Adam next appears in Superman's Fortress of Solitude, proclaiming anarchy cannot be allowed to spread when he learns of the people's insurrection. Black Adam is a super-villain and sometimes anti-hero originally written as the evil counterpart to Captain Marvel, now known as Shazam. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe: Dark Kahn | Shang Tsung | Scorpion Ravager (Grant Wilson) | [6], As Kahndaq's ruler, Adam is depicted as fiercely working to protect his people and his nation, although his arrogance is still a handicap; when the Spectre attacked Kahndaq after being corrupted by Eclipso, Black Adam actually told his people that the JSA were also their enemy because he did not want to give his people the impression that he needed help to protect them, despite the fact that he was clearly outmatched by the Spectre's power.[6]. Doctor Poison | Black Adam stands trial again for the murders of the Batsons, and is acquitted when it is revealed that his fingerprints do not match those of Theo Adam. Simon Stagg | Funky Flashman |  Earthworm | Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe: Dark Kahn | Shang Tsung | Lex Luthor According to Shazam!  Krona | Using her Parasite, Khronos, she is able to manipulate multiple timelines, watching how they play out while snagging the occasional collectible. Captain Cold Criminal Master of Chill.

Maxwell Lord | Sportsmaster | Mirror Master | Rainbow Raider | Plot unknown. However, he saves him from being crushed by a falling building.

Pied Piper | Stinger | Maxie Zeus | Nevertheless, Ares obtains the Book of Peace, on his own, leading Eris, Ares' superior, to set in motion her next plan, to dispose of Zeus.
