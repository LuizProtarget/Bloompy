On win64, the unwind-information are placed in xdata-section and there is the .pdata (function descriptor table) instead of the stack. It's extremely easy to setup. Exception handling is commonly not resumable in those languages, and when an exception is thrown, the program searches back through the stack of function calls until an exception handler is found. However, before the exception-handler block is executed, the __finally block of the termination handler is executed because the flow of control has left the __try block of the termination handler.
