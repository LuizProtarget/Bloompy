It is important to recognize that the resour-ces committed to each step described in this framework will vary substantially according to the relative complexity of individual projects. Helping communities appreciate local natural resources by encouraging incorporation of green principles and native landscaping. These characteristics of ecosystems represent a challenge for restoration practitioners faced with deciding which interventions are required to restore the characteristic composition, structure, and function of protected area ecosystems. Adaptive management forum: linking management and science to achieve ecological sustainability. [18] According to Nelson,[19] deforestation and degradation affect 8.5% of the world's forests with 30% of the Earth's surface already cropped. The Society for Ecological Restoration International defines ecological restoration as the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed (Society for Ecological Restoration International Science and Policy Working Group, 2004). Placing priority on removal of invasive plant and animal species that threaten ecological integrity at landscape and regional levels. However, the responses of ecosystems to these changes cannot be predicted with certainty. Introduction to the Hazard Ranking System. The restored ecosystem is sufficiently resilient to endure the normal periodic stress events in the local environment that serve to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem. [17], At present, there is a particular concern for rainforest regions that hold most of the Earth's biodiversity. Parks Canada. A place valued by an Aboriginal group (or groups) because of their long and complex relationship with that land. Aboriginal peoples Parks Research Forum of Ontario State-of-the-Art Workshop Series #2. It seeks to address the key governance issues in the extractive sectors. March 1999. They are a distillation of âbest practices' for the planning and implementation of ecological restoration projects in Canada's protected natural areas. Natural Resource Management Defined. Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA) Between The Government Of Canada, The Council For Yukon Indians and The Government Of The Yukon (1993). [5] A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the Brundtland Commission and the advocacy of sustainable development. fisheries) would trigger the need to restore in protected natural areas that are managed for values related to natural landscapes or seascapes or to the sustainable flow of products and services (IUCN category V and VI). In identifying the community of interest, project managers should identify target stakeholder groups and their social values and demographics. wetlands designated under the international Ramsar convention; Ramsar 1971), wildlife and forest reserves, wilderness areas, provincial and territorial parks, and other conservation areas designated through federal, provincial and territorial legislation (Environment Canada 2006). [online] URL: http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/mnr/forests/t&t_research/publications/adaptman.pdf. Some examples of common property are community forests. The first step in the ecological restoration planning process should be the identification of an initial set of natural and cultural heritage values to be considered in the proposed project. It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. A plant variety that has undergone genetic selection by plant breeders for agronomic traits, has been registered by a certifying agency, and is propagated under specific guidelines to maintain its genetic diversity. Commonwealth of Australia 2002. Ecological restoration helps parks and protected areas agencies respond to these challenges. A specified state of a specific element of the reference ecosystem or outcome. 2(2):110-115. Energy Policy 39: 990–998, Theodore Roosevelt, Address to the Deep Waterway Convention Hobbs, Richard J. Executive Director  In defining the project scope, available options for achieving objectives should be considered. Where actual reference ecosystems can be identified and monitored, comparisons amongst control (untreated but impaired) sites, reference (unimpaired) sites, and the treated (restored) sites before, during and after treatment increases the certainty of statistical analysis as well as the level of generalization of results (Lake 2001). biosphere reserves, natural heritage systems). Finally, as is emphasized by Hobbs and Norton (1996) and Hobbs and Harris (2001), restoration should not only focus on individual sites but on the landscape as a whole, with the watershed (catchment) being the primary level of organization. Organisms that occur naturally in a particular area instead of being introduced, directly or indirectly, by human activity. Data management plans should also address data integrity, digital file maintenance, and data migration and include plans for efficient data and information sharing within and among protected areas agencies. The Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements. Web pages. The ability of an ecosystem to regain structural and functional attributes that have suffered harm from stress or disturbance. Protecting quantity of surface water and groundwater resources during restoration activities. Cultural landscape The effort required to design and execute monitoring programs, to collect, evaluate, analyze, interpret, and synthesize data, and to report results should not be under-estimated (Parks Canada 2007). Many ecological restoration projects will require ongoing maintenance in the future (e.g., periodic removal of invasive alien species). They can lead to the development of a constituency of informed, involved and committed partners, stakeholders, community members, public and visitors who will serve as effective stewards of these special places. Handbook of Ecological Restoration. 66 pages. Like ecological risk assessment, it is fundamentally a values and goal-driven process that identifies, organizes and analyzes diverse scientific and socio-cultural information to make informed decisions about appropriate management actions. engaging the public and neighbours, information sharing, routine reporting) as well as the target audience and frequency. Downloaded from: http://www.cbin.ec.gc.ca. For example, data and information for a given project should be easy to retrieve in order for monitoring and reporting of project components (see sections 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7) to be effective. Natural resource management (NRM) is the management of natural resources such as land, water, soil, plants and animals, with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations (stewardship). If you choose not to use Acrobat Reader you can have the PDF file converted to HTML or ASCII text by using one of the c onversion services offered by Adobe. enjoyment by humans) or to sustainable uses (e.g. Every man-made product is composed of natural resources (at its fundamental level). Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). In many cases, existing monitoring and assessment frameworks may provide sufficient data to identify cases in which the ecological values of a protected area are threatened and should be restored. Consideration of the temporal scope of the project is critical in that some objectives (e.g. Ecological Management and Restoration. Found insideArid environments are basically associated with water scarcity. Therefore, soils will have an extremely low moisture level to support plant and animal life as well as human social life. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice: Integrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). [25][26][27][28] The term conservation biology was introduced as the title of a conference held at the University of California, San Diego, in La Jolla, California, in 1978, organized by biologists Bruce A. Wilcox and Michael E. Soulé. Schilling M and Chiang L 2011 The effect of natural resources on sustainable development policy: The approach of non-sustainable externalities. Deliver a smart, fun, inspiring guest experience. Potential adverse impacts of restoration projects on visitor experience should also be considered during project planning. Most have chapters dealing with harvesting or wildlife management issues. 444 pp. We would like to show you a description here but the site won’t allow us. Helping communities appreciate local natural resources by encouraging incorporation of green principles and native landscaping. The ecological integrity of protected areas, and thus their ability to conserve biodiversity and natural capital, faces a number of threats. Material remains of the association may be prominent, but will often be minimal or absent (Parks Canada 1999). In addition, the same stakeholders and partners may be consulted on related issues and become fatigued with the consultation process. Our Mission. Despite this goal, protected areas rarely contain complete, unaltered ecosystems, particularly in densely populated southern regions. As the marine protected areas network develops, and intergovernmental cooperation on planning and management continues, a variety of designations and zonations will allow for the protection of multiple values including wildlife habitat, fishery resources, ecological representation, cultural heritage (Environment Canada 2006) and the concept of ecologically sustainable use.
