Controlling the risk of spurious findings from meta-regression. However, questions of homogeneity apply to all aspects of the statistical distributions, including the location parameter. The results of the different studies, with 95% CI, and the overall effect (under the fixed and random effects model) with 95% CI are illustrated in a graph called "forest plot", for example: In this example the markers representing the effect size all have the same size. independent variables), or the measured outcome is distinctly different at that This is a post about the Diamond Ratio (DR), a simple measure of the extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis.We introduced the DR in ITNS.

See Meta-analysis: introduction for interpretation of the heterogeneity statistics Cohran's Q and I 2. It can be helpful to distinguish between different types of heterogeneity. I know I'm not teaching you anything. When heterogeneity is present the random effects model should be the preferred model. This study demonstrates that widely used meta-analytic methods do not produce accurate parameter estimates in the presence of study-level variance heterogeneity.

There can then be questions of examining the homogeneity across sites of the distribution of the scaled values. These data also provide quantitative physical information concerning the permeability upscaling of a complex heterogeneous medium.
