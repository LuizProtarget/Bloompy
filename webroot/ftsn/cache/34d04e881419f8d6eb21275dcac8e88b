Paranoia About Trump and Russia is Dangerous for Our Foreign Policy The consequences of the last McCarthy era were steep and lasted a generation; we can't afford a repeat. The harsh lockdown measures imposed in spring 2020 did not manage to significantly push down the number of active COVID-19 cases, which remained above 160,000 during that time. The Modern Foreign Policy of Russia. Russian foreign policy has long been characterized by soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country’s capabilities.

DGAP Report No. Russian foreign policy after the end of the cold war: Apparent discontinuities Russian foreign policy has evolved from an essentially eactive and, at times, incoherent basis, particularly throughout the first half of the 1990s, to a pro-active, consistent and affirmative policy, which has been reinforced under Putin. It is also likely that Moscow will wait for the next German chancellor to engage.

Russia learned this the hard way. However, Russia under Putin (like the Soviet Union before it) also pursues a global foreign policy. CSIS. Russian Foreign Policy. Fourth, from Russia’s perspective, its increasingly strong cooperation with China – as well as with Turkey and other powers – is indeed bearing fruit.

Although no legally binding US-Russian agreements in strategic arms control will be in place, new technologies will continue to allow more and more disruptive activities to shift to the cyber arena, space, or artificial intelligence.

The ability of the state to guarantee the rule of law and breathing room for private initiative is one of the key conditions for successful reform. But this dialogue is likely to go hand in hand with the development of strategic weapons on both sides. In contrast to that approach, the more evolved Russian foreign policy has brought results.

Nevertheless, the Kremlin has adamantly kept arguing that the data has been accurate and Russia has been managing the crisis well. Dealing with them effectively has been the Kremlin’s primary goal. Paradoxically the West can benefit from the success of these alliances. Russian politicians have a hard time striking a balance between cooperation and domination in bilateral ties with the neighbors as well as within Russia-led alliances. In the short term, however, this predictability is likely to mean steadily cold relations, in which cooperation will be limited to only the most urgent issues, in particular, arms control. Still, any new agreements on arms control will be very difficult to reach. Russian Foreign Policy in Historical and Current Context: A Reassessment | RAND.

Russia and the Costs of EU Foreign Policy Division. With chances for European-Russian cooperation slim, containment must remain the focus of the EU’s policy vis-à-vis Moscow. Three developments justified the choice of this focus for the Strategy Group one year ago: Limited progress in diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine, French President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative to improve France’s bilateral relations with Moscow (as a pretext to improve EU-Russia relations), The German EU Presidency in the second half of 2020. This idea will run counter to the theory of democratization as the guarantor of stable development. In the short run, however, this predictability is only likely to mean steadily cold relations, in which cooperation is limited to the most necessary fields, including a limited extension of New START in February 2021. Third, the case of Alexei Navalny – his poisoning and especially his recent detainment in Russia – will prevent the EU and Germany from moving toward more dialogue and selective engagement.

The book analyzes several historical examples and concludes that we cannot understand Russian foreign policy without understanding its culture.
