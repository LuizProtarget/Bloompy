COURSE OVERVIEW This course explains how testers and developers can determine if their web applications are vulnerable to the A10:2017 Insufficient Logging and Monitoring vulnerability, as identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Given that we log and monitor sufficiently, how can this prevent an attack for example - attack where username and password is guessed over several attempts? But why is a seemingly simple task ending up being a crucial point of information system security? Having these logs allows monitoring software to scan for suspicious behavior, such as 1000 login attempts in 5 seconds or connections to or from known malicious IP addresses. This means that they removed the highly-controversial A7 (“insufficient attack protection”) from RC1 and kept it off. An attacker uses scanning tools for users with a common password.

Fileless attacks, for example, will not drop any malicious files onto hard drives – meaning there is no file to be detected by always-on anti-virus monitoring software. Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to dig deeper into systems, stay embedded even after detected, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring and active response occurs any time: Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions are not logged. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring and active response occurs any time: * Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions are not logged.
